## C.30.TFS-REL - Architecture Transformation-Flow Structure Relation

> **Type:** Architectural pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative
> **Tech-name:** `ArchitectureTransformationFlowStructureRelation` (relation record)
> **Plain-name:** architecture transformation-flow structure relation
> **Governed object:** the architecture-side relation from `ArchitectureOf@Context`, selected architecture-relevant structure, architecture structural view, or conditional architecture-description use to one selected `TransformationFlowStructure` under `E.18` or one selected `TransformationFlowStructureNetwork` under `E.18.NET`.

### C.30.TFS-REL:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when an architecture discussion depends on a selected `TransformationFlowStructure`, one selected `TransformationFlowStructureNetwork`, or a current path, path slice, crossing, flow valuation, edition pin, plane pin, context pin, no-hidden-scalarization claim, or mathematical description of the selected flow structure.

The first useful move is small. `ArchitectureTransformationFlowStructureRelation@Context` relates one named architecture locus to the selected E.18 TFS or E.18.NET network used in the architecture question. It names the architecture claim, selected structure or view, conditional description use, relevant functional and flow refs, mathematical or publication source when current, correspondence, hidden-structure return, admissible use, and—when a network is selected—whether one named containing holon or several explicitly named holons supply the architecture side.

Ordinary minimum: name at least one architecture-side reference (`architectureClaimRef`, `selectedArchitectureStructureRefs`, `architectureStructuralViewRef`, `architectureDescriptionRef` when durable description use is being made, `containingArchitectureClaimRef`, or `participatingArchitectureClaimRefs[]`), at least one flow-structure reference (`transformationFlowStructureRef`, `transformationFlowStructureNetworkRef`, `transformationFlowUnfoldingStructureRef`, `selectedPathOrSliceRefs`, `crossingBundleRefs`, or `flowValuationRefs`), one blocked overread, and stop or governing-pattern application. A network use also selects exactly one network architecture-use branch and supplies its required architecture claim refs. Use the remaining conditional fields only when they change the next architecture move; otherwise mark them `not used`.

Use this relation only when a grounded architecture claim, selected architecture-relevant structure, architecture structural view, functional-architecture view, transformation-flow-structure claim, or conditional architecture-description use depends on an E.18 TFS, an E.18.NET network, or one of the selected TFS's paths, crossings, or valuations. Stop when that architecture-to-flow-structure relation and its non-admissible uses are clear. If another claim is being made, apply its governing pattern and keep this record to the architecture relation.

What goes wrong if this pattern is missed: a transformation-flow diagram, graph-shaped mathematical description, path slice, or flow valuation becomes functional architecture, whole architecture ontology, performed-work occurrence, work-result record, evidence, gate passage, or project decision by appearance.

What this buys in practice: the practitioner can use E.18 for one TFS or E.18.NET for one network while C.30 remains the grounded architecture and selected-structure adequacy locus and C.30.ASV remains the architecture-structural-view locus.

Not this pattern when the question is only the TFS or network, a mathematical description, path, crossing, or flow valuation and no architecture relation is being claimed. Use E.18 for one TFS, E.18.NET for one network, E.18.2 for its mathematical description, and C.29 when mathematical-lens use is current. Use C.30 for an architecture claim or durable architecture description without this flow-structure relation; use C.30.ASV and A.6.F for a functional view without it. Apply any other claim's governing pattern and keep C.30.TFS-REL only to the architecture relation.

### C.30.TFS-REL:2 - Problem

Grounded architecture claims, selected architecture-relevant structures, architecture structural views, and conditional architecture descriptions often need E.18 TFS objects or one E.18.NET network when they discuss transformation-flow structure, functional dependencies, data movement, control paths, evidence-flow descriptions, neural-network dataflow, or code-agent relation graphs.

C.30.TFS-REL prevents collapse by requiring the selected architecture-side reference before any E.18 TFS, E.18.NET network, path, slice, crossing, or valuation receives architecture use. A network additionally needs the containing-holon or explicit inter-holon branch; its graph or record cannot supply that branch.

### C.30.TFS-REL:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Transformation-flow relation vs architecture takeover | One E.18 TFS, one E.18.NET network, or a selected path or crossing can be essential, but none becomes all architecture ontology or an unnamed characteristic bearer. |
| Functional view vs transformation-flow view | A functional structure view may need a transformation-flow relation, but a path, crossing, valuation, or mathematical description is not a functional element by itself. |
| Structure precision vs work overread | E.18 gives selected structure, path, and flow-valuation objects; work occurrence and work results remain outside this relation unless their own pattern governs the claim being made. |
| No-hidden-scalarization vs architecture scoring | E.18 set-return and no-hidden-scalarization discipline can inform architecture reasoning, but it does not become a general architecture score. |
| Small relation vs unneeded non-architecture apparatus | A project often needs one relation record, not a full C.29 lens card, evidence relation, assurance case, or decision record. |
| Flow-structure-owner stability vs C.30 integration | An architecture claim, selected flow structure, architecture structural view, or conditional architecture-description use needs a relation to E.18 for one TFS or E.18.NET for one network without rewriting either owner as generic architecture adequacy theory. |

### C.30.TFS-REL:4 - Solution

C.30.TFS-REL is the C.30 entry relation to E.18 and E.18.NET when a grounded architecture claim, selected architecture-relevant structure, architecture structural view, or conditional architecture description uses one selected `TransformationFlowStructure`, one selected `TransformationFlowStructureNetwork`, or a current path, crossing, or flow valuation as an architecture-relevant transformation-flow relation.

It supplies only the architecture-to-transformation-flow relation:

At least one architecture-side field and at least one E.18 or E.18.NET field must be named by value. Network branch fields obey `C.30.TFS-REL:4.4a`; other optional fields stay `not used` unless they change inspection, correspondence, hidden relation-structure return, governing-pattern application, or stop.

#### C.30.TFS-REL:4.1 - Use trigger

Use this pattern only when an `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim being made, selected architecture-relevant structure, architecture structural view, functional-structure view, transformation-flow-structure claim, or conditional `ArchitectureDescription@Context` use depends on one or more E.18 or E.18.NET objects:

- `TransformationFlowStructureRef`;
- `TransformationFlowStructureNetworkRef`, when architecture use selects an E.18.NET-conforming network;
- `PathId` or `PathSliceId`;
- `CrossingBundleRef`;
- flow valuation over the `U.Transfer` relation;
- edition, plane, or context pin;
- no-hidden-scalarization or set-return discipline;
- correspondence between functional structure and transformation-flow structure;
- generated or extracted relation graph used as candidate input for the architecture-to-transformation-flow relation.

If the sentence only says that Work occurred, use A.15 or the governing Work pattern. If it only says that one selected TFS exists, use E.18; if it only says that one independently identified E.18.NET-conforming TFS network is selected, use E.18.NET. If the sentence uses a graph-shaped expression as mathematical description, use E.18.2. If it relies on a mathematical lens, use C.29.

Use `transformationFlowUnfoldingStructureRef?` only when the architecture relation depends on an `E.18.3` transformation-flow unfolding structure: the selected E.18 structure is being unfolded toward next architecture, decision, work, feedback, narrative, or refresh uses under constraints and direct exits. Generic architecture use of a constraint-governed unfolding structure belongs in `C.32.P2S` or the direct C.30 architecture governing pattern; this pattern keeps only the architecture-to-transformation-flow relation.

#### C.30.TFS-REL:4.2 - Relation to functional structure

`FunctionalStructureView@Context` under C.30.ASV may cite `ArchitectureTransformationFlowStructureRelation@Context` when a transformation-flow relation is being used. That relation does not make the selected E.18 structure a functional element and does not make a functional element identical with the system, module, method, or flow. It says that a functional structure view, functional behavior, or selected functional element corresponds to, is declared relative to, or positively co-refers with one E.18 selected structure, path, crossing, or valuation relation under a named context.

`FunctionalElement@Context` is a view-local functional-structure record governed by C.30.ASV, not a new root kind. It is current only when C.30.ASV has a selected functional structure view, bounded context, functional behavior, and bearer or candidate-bearer locus. Its functional behavior may be a bounded `U.Transformation` or a compound `TransformationFlowStructure`; its transformer-side filler is recovered through A.3.4 when a transformer claim is current; its module relation is allocation or correspondence through A.6.M. A graph-shaped expression, path, valuation, or flow packet is therefore not the functional element by default.

Use this note when the practitioner needs to see whether the function-to-transformation-flow relation changes inspection, split, relation-making, downgrade, claim-governance assignment named by value, candidate generation, or stop. Use C.30.ASV for the functional structure view, A.6.F for function-like wording recovery, A.3.4 for bounded transformation and transformer slots, A.6.M for module-allocation claims and module-correspondence claims, and E.18 for selected transformation-flow structure.

`FunctionTransformationFlowRelationNote` is the one-TFS form. When architecture use selects a network, use the top-level `ArchitectureTransformationFlowStructureRelation@Context` and the branch in `C.30.TFS-REL:4.4a`. Name a member TFS in this note only when the function correspondence is actually to that member; membership in the selected network alone does not create a function correspondence.

When several transformation-flow variants are kept or compared as candidate architecture inputs, keep each selected transformation-flow structure, path, crossing, valuation, graph-shaped expression, or mathematical description under `E.18`, `E.18.2`, and this relation. Apply `C.32` only to the architecture candidate palette that uses those selected structures. The graph, path, and flow description does not become architecture adequacy, evidence, assurance, gate passage, selected-set publication, or decision by serving as a candidate input.

#### C.30.TFS-REL:4.3 - Claim-kind applications named by value

| Claim kind being made | Governing pattern to apply |
| --- | --- |
| Work occurrence or work result | `A.15` and the governing work-result or P2W relation |
| Gate decision | `A.21` |
| Evidence claim | `A.10` or `G.6` |
| Assurance claim | `B.3` |
| Causal flow or intervention claim | `C.28` |
| Mathematical-lens use | `C.29` |
| Architecture description or view adequacy | `C.30` or `C.30.ASV` |
| Function-like wording | `A.6.F` |
| Interface, signature, or module compatibility | `A.6.M` module-and-interface repair plus `A.6.5` slot discipline, with `A.6.0` only when a signature declaration is being made |
| Architecture decision | the project-side architecture decision pattern when the corresponding claim is being made |

This table is the single boundary for generic non-flow claims. Elsewhere in this pattern, keep only blocked local overreads that the transformation-flow relation itself makes tempting: structure-as-architecture, graph-description-as-architecture, flow-as-work-log, crossing-as-gate, valuation-as-score, generated relation-graph proof, and prompt-data-tool flow as authority proof.

#### C.30.TFS-REL:4.4 - E.18 selected-structure boundary statement

For an E.18-governed selected `TransformationFlowStructure` used by `ArchitectureOf@Context`, selected architecture-relevant structure, architecture structural view, or conditional `ArchitectureDescription@Context`, an architecture-to-transformation-flow relation may cite the selected E.18 structure over the described holon plus MVPK faces and correspondences.

Grounded architecture adequacy and conditional architecture-description use are governed by C.30. E.18 supplies selected transformation-flow structure objects and relations; it does not define all architecture structure kinds.

This is the named E.18 selected-structure boundary statement for this relation. It is not a second E.18 source of truth and does not depend on a section number staying stable.

#### C.30.TFS-REL:4.4a - Architecture use of a transformation-flow structure network

First ask whether one exact `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim for a named holon includes the selected network in `structureRefs`. If it does not, ask whether the architecture question relies on claims for several named holons while no containing holon has been grounded. Select exactly one branch; a connected diagram does not answer either question.

1. **Named containing-holon use.** Set `networkArchitectureUseBranch=namedContainingHolon`. Name exactly one `containingArchitectureClaimRef: ArchitectureOf@Context` whose `describedHolonRef` identifies the containing holon and whose `structureRefs` include the same exact `transformationFlowStructureNetworkRef`; keep `participatingArchitectureClaimRefs[]` and `noArchitectureOfNetworkBearerAsserted` absent. Member TFS values and their Work, valuations, boundaries, and direct relations remain independently governed.
2. **Explicit inter-holon use.** Set `networkArchitectureUseBranch=explicitInterHolon`. Put at least two exact `ArchitectureOf@Context` claims with distinct `describedHolonRef` values in `participatingArchitectureClaimRefs[]`. Include exactly the claims whose selected structures or architecture characteristics this inter-holon question relies on; a network member whose architecture is not used by the question stays outside this array. Keep `containingArchitectureClaimRef` absent and set `noArchitectureOfNetworkBearerAsserted=true`. This states an architecture relation question spanning the named holons; it does not invent a holon or an `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim whose bearer is the network.

Every other populated architecture-side reference must agree with the selected branch. In `namedContainingHolon`, `architectureClaimRef` when present equals `containingArchitectureClaimRef`, each value in `selectedArchitectureStructureRefs` is selected by that claim, and each architecture structural view, architecture description, or functional structure view used by this relation points through that claim. In `explicitInterHolon`, each such reference points through one named participating claim; a singular reference names only that participant and does not imply a containing architecture. If a reference depends on another architecture claim, add that claim as a participant only when the current question actually relies on it, or use a separate relation record.

The branches are mutually exclusive. When `transformationFlowStructureNetworkRef` is absent, `networkCrossFlowRelationRowRefs[]` and all network branch fields are absent. A network ref without one complete branch is not ready for architecture use. When the record also names a path, slice, crossing, or valuation, bind it to the exact member TFS and the local positions or bindings that own it. When it names a network-aware unfolding, that E.18.3 locator must select the same exact network and preserve its admitted position mappings. The network ref does not lift member-local values into network-global state.

Use `networkCrossFlowRelationRowRefs[]` only for E.18.NET-owned composite locators. Each locator's current containing record must describe the same exact selected network, and the occurrence plus complete ordered endpoint-binding identity must resolve exactly one nested row. Zero matches, several matches, or a record for a different network stop this architecture use. The locator identifies the row; it neither creates the relation occurrence nor changes its direct governor.

For every maintainability, capability, responsibility, production, safety, or other architecture-characteristic claim made or used by this relation, name the exact holon, `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim, selected structure, view, relation, or other bearer governed by C.30. A network may have selected structural facts, such as its members, relations, recursion, or exposed positions; those facts do not make an unnamed network the bearer of holon characteristics, agency, Work, or production.

A network diagram, member graph, mathematical description, publication, or `TransformationFlowStructureNetworkRecord@Context` is neither branch and does not enter architecture identity. It may describe the selected network only under its description or publication pattern.

**Named containing-holon case.** `ArchitectureOf@ManufacturingPlatform` names the manufacturing platform as `describedHolonRef` and includes one product-development/production-system-change network in `structureRefs`. C.30.TFS-REL may use that network to localize an architecture change while each member TFS and production relation keeps its own owner.

**Explicit inter-holon case.** A supplier architecture claim and a plant architecture claim use one selected E.18.NET-conforming supply-linked TFS network to inspect a cross-company dependency. Both claims appear in `participatingArchitectureClaimRefs[]`; no containing supply-chain holon has been grounded, so `noArchitectureOfNetworkBearerAsserted=true`. The network is not called the architecture of an unnamed enterprise.

#### C.30.TFS-REL:4.5 - Worked slices

**Functional architecture with a transformation-flow relation being claimed.** A team says, "The functional architecture is this flow diagram." The repair is:

```text
functionalStructureViewRef: required effects and dependencies
functionalElementRefs?: not used; no selected `FunctionalElement@Context` is being claimed
functionalBehaviorRefs?: required effect `authorize payment`
transformerSideFillerRefs?: not used
candidateBearerRefs?: not used
inputConditionRefs?: not used
outputConditionRefs?: not used
functionalPortRefs?: not used
transformationFlowStructureViewRef: selected E.18 transformation-flow structure, path structure, crossing structure, or flow-valuation structure
transformationFlowStructureRef: TransformationFlowStructure@PaymentAuthorization
selectedPathOrSliceRefs: path slices used for the architecture claim
correspondenceRefs: functional effect to flow path relation
nonAdmissibleUse:
  flow diagram as functional architecture itself,
  selected transformation-flow structure as work occurrence,
  mathematical graph description as evidence sufficiency,
  crossing as gate result,
  flow relation as project decision
```

Filled relation record:

```text
ArchitectureTransformationFlowStructureRelation@Context:
architectureClaimRef: ArchitectureOf@CheckoutServiceContext
selectedArchitectureStructureRefs: selected request-handling and payment-authorization flow structure
architectureStructuralViewRef: ArchitectureStructuralView@CheckoutRuntimeFlow
architectureDescriptionRef: not used; the durable architecture description is not being evaluated here
functionalStructureViewRef: FunctionalStructureView@CheckoutRequiredEffects
functionalElementRefs: not used

selectedPathOrSliceRefs: PathSlice@request-to-payment-authorization
crossingBundleRefs: not used
flowValuationRefs: not used
mathematicalDescriptionRefs: not used
correspondenceRefs: required effect `authorize payment` corresponds to the E.18 path slice; this is correspondence, not identity
sourcePublicationOrEditionRef: model or generated graph edition when the flow relation was extracted from one
extractionOrProbeLocusRef: path-slice extraction or code-agent probe locus when current
relationObservationClassRef: observed, inferred, or unknown relation class when current
unexploredRegionRefs: not used
hiddenRelationStructureReturnCondition: reopen if mathematical-description edition, path slice, relation observation class, or required-effect declaration changes
admissibleUse: inspect whether the functional structure view depends on the E.18 path slice being used and whether an architecture split or correspondence note is needed
nonAdmissibleUse: flow diagram as functional architecture itself; selected transformation-flow structure as work occurrence; mathematical graph description as evidence sufficiency; crossing as gate result; flow relation as project decision
```

Near miss: if the selected transformation-flow structure has no C.30-side architecture reference named by value, the case stays in `E.18`. If the same sentence is a mathematical description, use `E.18.2`; if it is a math-lens-use claim, use `C.29`. If it is a work log, evidence claim, gate decision, or benchmark result, that non-flow claim is governed by its governing pattern and this relation keeps only the architecture-to-transformation-flow relation.

**Pump-station flow relation.** A plant team says, "the safety architecture is the bypass flow." C.30.TFS-REL applies only if the plant `ArchitectureOf@Context`, selected control or material-flow structure, and E.18 selected bypass-flow structure are named. The bypass path may be architecture-relevant, but it is not safety proof, performed maintenance work, gate passage, or release permission. The relation record names the plant architecture locus, selected E.18 path or crossing, hidden relation-structure return condition, and the one architecture move changed by the bypass relation.

**Supply-chain transformation-flow relation.** A logistics architecture view may use an E.18 selected flow structure for supplier handoff, transport crossing, freshness window, and valuation. The architecture claim remains about selected supply-chain structure; work occurrences, contractual commitments, evidence, and gate decisions stay with their governing patterns.

**Neural-network dataflow change.** Source labels such as attention block, SSM block, convolution block, memory mechanism, cache mechanism, and MoE expert-selection go through `C.30.STRAT` unless the changed value is already recovered. C.30.TFS-REL applies only when the changed structure kind and transformation-flow relation are named. A benchmark, ablation, or pruning result may bear on a non-architecture claim named by value, but it does not make the flow relation an architecture decision or evidence sufficiency by itself.

**Code-agent relation graph.** A code-agent relation graph with `IMPORTS`, `CALLS_API`, `REGISTRY_WIRES`, or `DATA_FLOWS_TO` edges can be used for an architecture-to-transformation-flow relation only with the source publication or codebase edition, extraction or probe locus, relation observation class selected from {observed, inferred, unknown}, typed relation semantics, unexplored regions, and hidden relation-structure return condition when subsequent action relies on hidden distinctions.

#### C.30.TFS-REL:4.6 - Lowering and currentness conditions

Lower, narrow, or reopen the relation at the smallest changed locus when:

- E.18 one-TFS structure, path, crossing, or flow-valuation semantics change;
- E.18.NET network identity, direct membership, exposed positions, exact cross-member relations, or nested-row locator resolution changes;
- the selected network architecture branch or any containing or participating architecture claim used by that branch changes;
- edition, plane, context pin, set-return, or no-hidden-scalarization discipline changes;
- source publication or graph edition, path slice, relation observation class, edition or context pin, unexplored region, or hidden relation-structure return condition changes;
- the C.30 architecture locus, selected architecture-relevant structure, architecture structural view, conditional architecture description, or C.30.ASV relation changes;
- functional-to-transformation-flow correspondence changes;
- a non-flow claim is being made and is governed by `C.30.TFS-REL:4.3` rather than by this relation;
- C.29, C.16, C.28, A.10, G.6, B.3, A.20, A.21, A.15, C.30, C.30.ASV, A.6.F, C.30.STRAT, E.18, or E.18.NET changes the governing boundary used by the relation.

Admissible repair results are: update the affected TFS or network reference, network branch, or row locator; add or change correspondence or the hidden relation-structure return condition; narrow admissible use; keep the one-TFS claim inside E.18 and the network claim inside E.18.NET; keep the mathematical-description claim inside E.18.2; keep the math-lens-use claim inside C.29; apply the governing pattern to a non-flow claim; lower to quote-only or reduced-use cue; or block the architecture-to-transformation-flow use.

### C.30.TFS-REL:5 - Archetypal Grounding

| Tell-Show-Show row | Grounding |
| --- | --- |
| Tell | A practitioner sees one TFS or several connected TFSs and wants to use that flow structure in an architecture question. C.30.TFS-REL makes them name the exact TFS or network and the architecture locus; for a network, they choose one containing claim or the exact participating claims. The result is one usable architecture relation or an exact stop, not an architecture claim inferred from the diagram. |
| Show: `U.System` | A software system, plant, AI agent, neural network, vehicle, or supply chain may have transformation-flow structure. A diagram or mathematical description can inform architecture reasoning about that structure without carrying the non-flow claims named in `C.30.TFS-REL:4.3`. |
| Show: `U.Episteme` | A mathematical graph description, generated relation graph, code-agent probe, neural-network diagram, dashboard, or architecture note is an episteme, view, or publication. It can publish or substantiate the transformation-flow relation only when the exact E.18 TFS or E.18.NET network, the selected network architecture branch when applicable, context pins, correspondence, any relied-on row locator, hidden relation-structure return condition, and admissible use are recoverable. |

### C.30.TFS-REL:6 - Bias-Annotation

Lenses tested: **Arch**, **Onto**, **Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**, **Gov**. Scope: architecture-to-transformation-flow relations using E.18 TFS or E.18.NET network objects.

| Bias risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Structure-or-description-as-architecture bias | The pattern states that grounded architecture adequacy and conditional architecture-description use stay with C.30, mathematical descriptions stay with E.18.2, math-lens uses stay with C.29, and structural views stay with C.30.ASV. |
| Function-flow collapse | Functional structure and transformation-flow structure are related, not identical by default. Identity requires a positive selected-structure co-reference check. |
| Non-flow claim overread | The relation table assigns non-flow claim kinds to their governing patterns. |
| Mathematical overread | Mathematical-lens use of a graph or valuation is governed by C.29. |
| Check-only bias | Conformance checks include repair actions and stop conditions. |

This checklist verifies the preceding guidance after the practitioner has chosen the selected repair action; it is not a required project control form and not a substitute for the card, note, relation, or repair guidance above.

### C.30.TFS-REL:7 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Failed-check repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CC-C30TFR-1 Flow-structure object.** | The relation names the exact E.18 TFS, E.18.NET network, path, slice, crossing, or flow valuation object it uses. | Add the exact E.18 or E.18.NET reference named by value, or use C.30 or C.30.ASV without this relation. |
| **CC-C30TFR-2 Architecture locus.** | The relation names `ArchitectureOf@Context`, selected architecture-relevant structure, architecture structural view, or conditional `ArchitectureDescription@Context` use it relates to. | Add `architectureClaimRef`, `selectedArchitectureStructureRefs`, `architectureStructuralViewRef`, `architectureDescriptionRef`, `containingArchitectureClaimRef`, or `participatingArchitectureClaimRefs[]` as the selected use requires; otherwise keep the TFS or network claim with E.18 or E.18.NET, the mathematical-description claim with E.18.2, or the math-lens-use claim with C.29. |
| **CC-C30TFR-3 Functional and flow separation.** | Functional structure and transformation-flow structure remain separate unless correspondence or positive selected-structure co-reference is declared. | Add `FunctionTransformationFlowRelationNote`, add the co-reference check, or remove the functional-architecture claim from the flow sentence. |
| **CC-C30TFR-4 No architecture takeover.** | The selected transformation-flow structure, network, or mathematical description is not treated as generic architecture ontology or all architecture structure kinds. | Assign grounded architecture claims, selected architecture-relevant structures, or conditional architecture-description use to C.30 and keep this pattern to the architecture-to-transformation-flow relation. |
| **CC-C30TFR-4a Network architecture branch.** | A network use selects exactly one branch. The containing branch has one `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim whose `structureRefs` include the exact network, and every other architecture-side ref agrees with that claim. The inter-holon branch has every architecture claim this question actually relies on, no containing claim, and `noArchitectureOfNetworkBearerAsserted=true`; a singular participant ref never implies a containing architecture. | Complete one branch, remove or reroute a conflicting architecture-side ref, add a participating claim only when the current question relies on it, or keep the network claim under E.18.NET without architecture use. |
| **CC-C30TFR-4b Named characteristic bearer and representation boundary.** | Every architecture characteristic claimed or used by this relation remains on an exact named bearer, and no graph, mathematical description, publication, or network record becomes the architecture claim or its bearer. | Name the holon, architecture claim, selected structure, view, relation, or other C.30-governed bearer; demote the representation to its description or publication use. |
| **CC-C30TFR-4c Member-local, unfolding, and row-reference boundary.** | Every path, slice, crossing, or valuation named with a network remains bound to its exact owning member TFS and local positions or bindings; a network-aware unfolding selects that same network through its E.18.3 locator; and every `NetworkCrossFlowRelationRowRef` resolves exactly one row in a current record for that network without replacing the obtaining relation occurrence. | Restore the member-local binding or network-locator match; repair or remove a row locator that resolves zero or several rows or points to another network; keep occurrence truth with its direct governor. |
| **CC-C30TFR-5 No work overread.** | A selected TFS, network, path, or slice is not treated as work occurrence or work result. | Assign the work claim to A.15 or the governing work-result pattern. |
| **CC-C30TFR-6 No evidence, assurance, or gate overread.** | The relation is not used as evidence sufficiency, assurance claim, gate decision, or release permission without evidence named by value, assurance, gate, or release pattern application. | Assign the claim being made to A.10, G.6, B.3, A.20, A.21, or the release locus named by value when a release claim is being made. |
| **CC-C30TFR-7 Causal and mathematical boundaries.** | Causal or intervention claims and mathematical-lens claims are assigned to C.28 and C.29. | Apply those governing patterns or narrow the relation's admissible use. |
| **CC-C30TFR-8 Pin and scalarization boundary.** | Edition, context, and plane pins plus no-hidden-scalarization claims remain E.18-governed. | Add E.18 pin and set-return references or remove the comparison or selection claim. |
| **CC-C30TFR-9 Hidden relation return.** | Extracted, generated, coarsened, or partial relation graphs or flow diagrams state the source publication or edition, extraction or probe locus, relation observation class, unexplored regions, and hidden relation-structure return condition when hidden distinctions affect action. | Add the missing relation-structure fields or narrow the admissible use. |
| **CC-C30TFR-10 Useful action.** | The repair leaves a remaining use: name the selected TFS, path, or crossing; choose the containing or inter-holon branch for a selected network; add correspondence; return to source; assign the claim being made to a governing pattern; or stop. | Restore that use, or classify the phrase as reduced-use cue, quote-only wording, blocked transfer, or incomplete rewrite. |
| **CC-C30TFR-11 Lowering and currentness.** | The relation states the smallest changed locus when E.18 TFS semantics or pins, E.18.NET network identity or relations, the selected network branch or architecture claims, a relied-on row locator, relation observation class, architecture locus, correspondence, hidden relation-structure return, or related governing boundary changes. | Update the affected TFS or network reference, branch, architecture claim, or row locator; narrow admissible use; keep the TFS or network claim inside E.18 or E.18.NET; keep the mathematical-description claim inside E.18.2; keep math-lens use inside C.29; apply the governing pattern to the non-flow claim; lower the relation; or block architecture-to-transformation-flow use. |

### C.30.TFS-REL:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Structure-as-architecture** | The E.18 selected transformation-flow structure is called the whole architecture. | Use C.30 for the grounded architecture claim, selected architecture-relevant structure, or conditional architecture description, and keep this relation only for the transformation-flow relation. |
| **Unnamed network as architecture bearer** | A connected network or its graph is assigned maintainability, capability, responsibility, agency, or production without one containing holon or explicit participating architecture claims. | Select the named-containing-holon branch or the explicit inter-holon branch, restore every characteristic to a named bearer, and keep the graph or record outside architecture identity. |
| **Graph-description-as-functional-architecture** | A graph-shaped mathematical description or diagram is treated as the functional architecture itself. | Split functional structure, selected transformation-flow structure, mathematical description, and publication face; add correspondence when needed. |
| **Flow-as-work-log** | Path or slice wording is treated as work occurrence. | Assign occurrence or result claims to A.15 or P2W and keep E.18 to selected structure, path, slice, or valuation. |
| **Crossing-as-gate-result** | A crossing relation is treated as gate passage. | Assign gate-decision claims to A.21 and keep crossing relation under E.18. |
| **Valuation-as-score** | A flow valuation is used as a generic architecture score. | State E.18 valuation and set-return discipline; assign measurement, characterization, selection, or candidate-set claims to `C.16` or an admitted governing pattern when those claims are being made. |
| **Generated relation-graph proof** | A code-agent relation graph or probe output is used as proof of architecture understanding or safety. | Recover the source publication or codebase edition, extraction or probe locus, relation observation class selected from {observed, inferred, unknown}, hidden structure, and evidence or assurance pattern governing the claim applications. |
| **Prompt-data-tool flow as authority proof** | A prompt, data, or tool-flow diagram is treated as permission for tool action or proof that authority is safe. | Keep the diagram as a transformation-flow relation or E.18.2 mathematical description. A path from untrusted content to tool action is governed by `SecurityTrustBoundaryStructure`, C.24, E.16, A.20, or A.21 when those claim kinds are being made. |

### C.30.TFS-REL:9 - Consequences

| Benefit | Cost or trade-off |
| --- | --- |
| E.18 TFS paths, crossings, and valuations and E.18.NET network structure become usable across grounded architecture claims, selected architecture-relevant structures, architecture structural views, and conditional architecture descriptions without merging their owners. | Every use names the exact C.30 architecture claim or relation record, selected architecture-relevant structure, C.30.ASV structural-view ref, or conditional architecture-description ref. A network use also names either one containing architecture claim or all participating architecture claims and keeps every characteristic on a named bearer. |
| Functional structure and transformation-flow structure stay separable unless positive co-reference is declared. | Concise "the diagram is the architecture" prose is repaired before it is used for an FPF claim kind or admissible-use boundary. |
| Non-flow claim kinds are assigned to their governing patterns. | More governing patterns are named when practitioners try to overuse the diagram, mathematical expression, or selected structure. |
| The E.18 selected-structure boundary statement stays narrow. | Generic architecture adequacy remains outside E.18. |

### C.30.TFS-REL:10 - Rationale

E.18 governs one selected TFS, its paths, crossings, valuations, and pins; E.18.NET governs one selected network and its exact cross-member relations. Architecture needs to use either object without taking over its ontology or inventing an unnamed architecture bearer. The smallest stable result is therefore one C.30-side relation record that points to those objects and states the containing-holon or inter-holon architecture use when a network is selected.

This pattern also protects functional architecture. A functional structure view may correspond to a transformation-flow structure, and in some cases both may refer to the same selected `U.StructureRef`; that identity is not automatic. The relation is useful precisely because it preserves the difference while allowing correspondence or positive co-reference.

### C.30.TFS-REL:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Practice or reference line | C.30.TFS-REL adoption | Action consequence | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E.18 one-TFS discipline and E.18.NET network discipline | Adopt E.18 as the owner of one TFS, its paths, crossings, and valuations; adopt E.18.NET as the owner of one selected network, member-local references, and exact cross-member relations. | The pattern names the exact TFS or network, then adds only the C.30 architecture locus and selected network branch. | Neither flow-structure owner becomes generic architecture ontology or architecture-description ontology. |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 and multi-view architecture practice | Adapt view and correspondence discipline to architecture-to-transformation-flow reliance. | Transformation-flow views relate to grounded architecture claims, selected architecture-relevant structures, architecture structural views, or conditional architecture descriptions through C.30, C.30.ASV, and correspondence refs. | Architecture views do not become proof, evidence, gates, or decisions. |
| MBSE and SysML v2 view and relation practice | Adapt model-derived flow views and path views as description-episteme relations derived from a model publication or model edition. | A model-derived flow view states model edition, selected structure, hidden or lost structure, and admissible use. | Tool models do not override FPF E.18 or C.30 relations. |
| Neural-network dataflow and GonzoML architecture-operation corpus | Adopt practitioner flow-structure recognition for block replacement, path-selection, memory and cache placement, MoE expert-selection, pruning, distillation, ablation, and compute, memory, and latency tradeoffs. | Keep block, cache, expert, router, gate, and similar words as `C.30.STRAT` source labels until the transformation-flow structure is recovered; C.30.TFS-REL applies only when that recovered structure changes the architecture move. | Benchmarks, ablations, pruning masks, or architecture-search outputs do not become evidence sufficiency, assurance, gate passage, or architecture decision by themselves. |
| Theory of Code Space and arXiv:2603.00601 code-agent relation graph probing | Adapt relation graphs with relation observation class selected from {observed, inferred, unknown} and partial-observability warnings. | Generated code relation graphs can be used for a transformation-flow relation only with typed relation semantics, source publication or codebase edition pins, extraction or probe locus, unexplored regions, and hidden relation-structure return condition. | Do not mint `U.CodeSpace`; do not treat probe output as internal belief proof, architecture adequacy, assurance, or release evidence or release claim. |

**Currentness boundary.** The inputs to the currentness judgment are E.18 TFS semantics and pins; E.18.NET network identity, cross-member relations, and row-locator resolution when selected; the chosen network architecture branch and its exact containing or participating claims; C.30 and C.30.ASV architecture-side relation rules; the relation observation class; and the non-flow governing patterns named in `C.30.TFS-REL:4.3`. When one changes, the relation changes only at the affected reference, branch or architecture claim, row locator, correspondence, hidden relation-structure return condition, admissible-use boundary, or governing-pattern assignment.

### C.30.TFS-REL:12 - Relations

Builds on: `C.30`, `C.30.ASV`, `A.22`, `A.6.F`, `E.18` for one TFS, `E.18.NET` for one selected conforming network and its exact obtaining cross-member relations, `E.17`, `E.17.0`, `A.7`, `E.10`, `C.2.P`, and `F.18`.

Coordinates with: `C.30.STRAT`, `C.32.P2S` when architecture-to-transformation-flow grounding is one stage of problem-to-structure architecturing, `C.32` when selected transformation-flow variants become candidate architecture inputs, `C.33` when transformation-flow relation descriptions capture or lose selected architecture structure, `C.34` when transformation-flow relation claims must be preserved across a mapping, model, generated output, or realization, `C.35` when a generated or discovered transformation-flow carrier may seed synthesis, `A.15`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `A.10`, `G.6`, `B.3`, `C.28`, `C.29`, `C.16`, admitted measurement, selection, or candidate-set governing patterns when those claims are being made, `A.6.M` module-and-interface repair, `A.6.5` slot discipline, and `A.6.0` when a signature declaration is being made.

Related claims stay with their governing patterns: `C.30.STRAT` for stratification wording and source-label repair, `E.18` for one selected transformation-flow structure, path, crossing, and flow-valuation discipline, `E.18.NET` for network identity and exact cross-member relations, `E.18.2` and `C.29` for mathematical descriptions and lens-use claims, `C.30` for grounded architecture and selected-structure adequacy, `C.30.ASV` for architecture structural-view adequacy, `C.32.P2S` for connected problem-to-structure carry-through, `A.6.F` for function-use repair, and the non-flow governing patterns named in `C.30.TFS-REL:4.3`. `C.30.TFS-REL` governs only the architecture use of the selected TFS or TFS network.
