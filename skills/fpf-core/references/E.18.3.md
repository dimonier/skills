### E.18.3:0 - Use This When

Use this pattern when a team is planning, reviewing, or explaining a transformation and a route-like flow card is useful, but branches, joins, guards, or connections to separately governed positions determine what can follow. The practical need is to recover those transformation-flow relations without treating displayed order as performed-work order, evidence, decision, or authorization.

The admitted object is the same selected `U.Structure` already identified under A.22 and qualified as a CGUS by exact constituents, selected obtaining relation occurrences, applied constraints and one named selection-use frame. E.18.3 recognizes that object under an additional transformation-flow unfolding condition; it does not manufacture a generic CGUS plus a reciprocal narrower structure. Its transformation-flow use reuses exact E.18 positions and bindings, direct relation occurrences and, when independent flows cross, one selected E.18.NET network.

Do not use this pattern merely because a visible record or description is a route, path, graph, process map, chain, loop, or swimlane. First ask whether typed transformation positions, exact crossings and guards, the correct one-TFS, internal-subflow or network case, preserved transformation structures, relevant C.33 adequacy notes, and direct governing-pattern exits are recoverable.

The first useful move is small: name the exact selected structure and current transformation subject, identify two candidate E.18 positions, and state the exact relation or guard that may change which continuation is admissible. Here `move` is Plain wording for that current use action, not a universal kind or relation; proposing or selecting it performs no Work. If the structure identity or relation occurrence is not recoverable, keep the visible artifact as an ordinary C.2.1 provisional demonstration episteme and return to the missing A.22.CGUS or direct-relation coordinate.

**What changes in practice.** The practitioner stops asking whether a diagram “looks like a flow” and instead recovers one selected structure, the exact E.18 or E.18.NET position bindings used by this question, already-obtaining relations, and the smallest honest stop or neighboring return. A demonstration can then guide attention without becoming the structure, a MethodDescription, a WorkPlan or performed Work.

### E.18.3:1 - Problem Frame

`E.18` already gives FPF a rich language for transformation-flow structure: transfers, dependencies, paths, crossings, guards, valuations, publication faces, comparability, slice-local refresh, and structure-positioned slot fillings. `A.22.CGUS` gives the broader A.22 specialization of `U.Structure` for constraint-governed unfolding structures. A practitioner needs the narrow bridge between them: when is an unfolding structure a transformation-flow unfolding structure, and which neighboring claims remain under their direct patterns?

### E.18.3:2 - Problem

Transformation-flow artifacts are easy to overread. A path diagram becomes a workflow. A flow card becomes performed work. A P2W chain becomes work authorization. A graph expression becomes the whole structure. A gate, evidence path, architecture decision, or publication face becomes part of the transformation-flow ontology by visual adjacency.

The repair cannot be lexical. E.18.3 qualification depends on one exact A.22-selected structure, the correct E.18 or E.18.NET case, independently governed transformation subjects, admitted position mappings, exact already-obtaining relation occurrences, separately claim-bearing structural-function and subject-use classifications when needed, preserved structures, C.33 adequacy notes, and distinct ordinary stop and neighboring returns.

### E.18.3:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Transformation-flow richness vs universal-parent drift | E.18 is rich enough to explain many route-shaped transformation cases, but narrative, abduction, grounding, improvement, and public practical-use cards or walkthroughs are not transformation-flow merely by shape. |
| Flow card usefulness vs work-order overread | A path or flow card can guide a next FPF use, but it does not authorize performed work or decide launch readiness. |
| Neighboring positions vs ontology absorption | Method, work, evidence, gate, decision, architecture, publication, and currentness positions can connect to a flow position without becoming transformation-flow kinds. |
| Demonstrative slices vs actual traces | A path slice may show a traversal for learning or review; actual project history may branch, pause, retry, or skip that traversal. |

### E.18.3:4 - Solution

E.18.3 is a membership-and-use profile for one exact selected A.22.CGUS `U.Structure`. The selected structure keeps the four A.22 identity discriminators. E.18.3 asks whether its current constituents, selected relation occurrences, constraints and use frame also satisfy the transformation-flow unfolding conditions below.

| Coordinate | Required transformation-flow recovery | Honest lower result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A.22 identity | One exact `selectedCGUSRef` resolves independently identified constituents, selected already-obtaining relation occurrences, applied constraints and one named selection-use frame. | Keep the current record, graph, table or explanation and return the missing A.22 discriminator. |
| Flow case | Classify the use as several valuations of one exact TFS, one parent-relative internal `SubflowRef`, or one E.18.NET network over independently identified TFS or nested-network members and exact cross-boundary occurrences. | Keep the flow cue; do not mint another TFS, network member or giant flattened flow. |
| Transformation subjects | Name each subject used by this unfolding question with its exact kind and direct owner. The ordinary case may have one transformed entity; a multi-object flow may need several independently identified subjects. | Keep the subject wording as a cue and stop before structure qualification. |
| Position mappings | More than one admitted `CGUSPositionLocator` maps through an exact E.18 `FlowPositionRef` and current position binding to the same selected constituent already named by that locator. | Keep candidate positions in the provisional episteme. |
| Relation basis | Every transfer, dependency, crossing or guard use cites an exact already-obtaining occurrence selected by the CGUS and its direct declaration and governor. A relation-reference episteme may classify that use but creates neither kind nor occurrence. | Keep a proposed edge or question and return the missing governor, predicate, facts, occurrence or binding. |
| Constraint and topology | Exact guards, constraints, branches, joins, cycles, partial orders or many-to-many dependencies change admissible continuations for the named use. | Keep the linear display provisional or narrow the use. |
| Preservation and exits | Exact preserved structures, relevant C.33 epistemes, ordinary stop, conditional neighboring returns and currentness-dependent reopen are visible. | Keep a one-use explanation and state the missing loss or return. |

Use this compact display only as a recovery aid; it is neither another record kind nor structure identity:

```text
selectedCGUSRef
flowCase: oneTFS | internalSubflow | network  # Plain choice for this use
transformationSubjectRows[]:
  subjectRef
  subjectKindRef
  directGovernorRef
transformationPositionMappingRows[]:
  admittedCGUSPositionLocator
  flowPositionRef
  exactPositionBindingRef

pathSliceIds[]?  # one-TFS use only
flowValuationRef?  # one-TFS use only
preservedTransformationStructureRefs[]
structureInformationAdequacyNoteRefs[]?
stopCondition
governingPatternReturnConditions[]
```

The first four A.22 discriminators, not this display, identify the selected structure. `flowCase` and the remaining rows show why that one structure qualifies and how the current use reaches its direct owners. No ambient context, transformed-subject label, path, valuation, tag, record edition, demonstration or profile field becomes another identity discriminator.

Paths and demonstrations remain different. `PathId`, `PathSliceId`, `FlowValuation` and the complete `FlowPositionRef` identity stay with one exact E.18 TFS. A post-admission A.22 demonstrative slice is a separate ordinary C.2.1 episteme whose EntityOfConcern is the admitted CGUS. A pre-admission flow card, worked example or explanation is a different C.2.1 episteme about the actual subject, question or proposed continuation set. A linear slice may teach one traversal while the selected structure branches, joins, cycles or keeps alternatives live.

A pattern-selection flow, selected-pattern-application flow and downstream-subject-work flow keep different EntitiesOfConcern, changes, Work occurrences, results, direct governing patterns, constraints and returns. If all relevant positions and internal `U.Transfer` occurrences resolve to one TFS, use its exact positions and, when current, one complete top-level demonstration locator `<transformationFlowStructureRef, pathSliceId, DesignRunTag>`. A detailed internal portion remains one parent-relative `SubflowRef`. If independently identified TFS or nested-network members cross, E.18.NET owns the network and exact cross-member occurrences; the mutually exclusive A.22 network locator applies and the top-level one-TFS triple is absent.

A result, tool, context, constraint, shared label or displayed arrow neither merges network members nor supplies their relation. Every member keeps its boundary, Work, actual transformations, valuations and leaf-local position state. Nested pattern-selection content is present only while its exact source or selection-provenance relation is current for the declared demonstration use. When present, it returns its own candidate, fit finding or recommendation rather than borrowing a later application result.

Preserved transformation structure is carried by exact `U.Structure` refs. Captured, expected-but-uncaptured, lost and hidden structure for the declared use remains in exact C.33 epistemes. Stop and neighboring return are ordinary use boundaries unless a direct pattern independently admits a relation occurrence. G.11 owns source currentness and decay; E.18 owns one-TFS slice-local refresh.

There is no generic method-to-work linkage here. When one named receiving use relies on a Method-to-Work claim, cite the exact already-obtaining relation or direct result returned by its owner and keep Method, qualifying MethodDescription, WorkPlan, readiness and dated Work separate. A governing-pattern ref, intended realization, selected continuation, imperative sentence or displayed sequence does not admit any episteme as `U.MethodDescription`. A.3.2 membership requires one already identified C.2.1 episteme whose exact EntityOfConcern is one admitted `U.Method` and whose ClaimContent makes at least one substantive way-of-doing claim. Method, qualifying MethodDescription, WorkPlan, work-entry result, dated Work, actual Transformation, production/inception/completion, evidence, evaluation and source-use claims stay under their exact owners and may enter the structure only through independently current objects and relations.

#### E.18.3:4.0 - Application sequence

1. Recover one selected A.22.CGUS and its four exact identity discriminators; do not create a reciprocal E.18.3 structure.
2. Name the current transformation subject or subjects, their kinds and the exact E.18 positions and bindings used by the question.
3. Classify the flow case as one TFS with its valuations, one parent-relative internal `SubflowRef`, or one E.18.NET network of independent members and exact crossings.
4. Cite every selected transfer, dependency, crossing or guard occurrence and its direct owner. Add a structural-function or subject-use claim only through the ordinary C.2.1 relation-reference episteme in `4.0a`.
5. Recover each neighboring governed position through its exact kind, ref and already-obtaining supporting relation. A result label, return arrow or comparison layout is not that relation.
6. Name preserved structures, relevant C.33 adequacy notes, an ordinary stop and conditional returns. For a post-admission demonstration, choose exactly one complete A.22 locator family: top-level one-TFS, network, or neither for a generic slice.
7. If any A.22 discriminator, position binding, direct relation, network row or required loss/return is missing, keep the artifact as a provisional C.2.1 episteme and state the exact blocker.

This sequence guides use of the pattern. It is not a local mantra, `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription`, WorkPlan or performed Work; completing the rows admits nothing by itself.

#### E.18.3:4.0a - Exact relation references

When another person or later use must replay why one selected relation occurrence has a transformation-flow structural function or supports a separately governed subject use, materialize one ordinary C.2.1 episteme. Its exact EntityOfConcern is the already-obtaining relation occurrence, its ClaimContent contains only the current reference use below, and its effective ReferenceScheme governs every designation. *Transformation-flow relation reference* is Plain wording for this use, not a local U-kind. Its edition and currentness remain ordinary C.2.1 and G.11 concerns; they do not add an identity field or ambient context.

```text
transformationFlowRelationReferenceClaimContent:
  selectedCGUSRef
  exactRelationOccurrenceRef
  exactRelationKindRef
  directGoverningPatternRef: exact governing-pattern identifier or reference
  relationSignatureRef?: exact declaration ref when current for this receiver
  structuralFunction?: transfer | dependency | crossing | guard
  subjectUse?: evidence | assurance | architecture | narrative | publication
  exactSubjectUseClaimOrRelationRef?: required when subjectUse is present
  networkEndpointBindingSets[]?:
  networkCrossFlowRelationRowRef: exact E.18.NET NetworkCrossFlowRelationRowRef
  endpointRows[]:
  relationParticipantPositionRef
  endpointMemberRef
  endpointFlowPositionRef: FlowPositionRef | ExposedFlowPositionRef
  endpointPositionBindingRef
```

The structural-function and subject-use values are Plain closed classifications of this ClaimContent, not relation kinds, SlotKinds or structure identity. At least one is present. `transfer` is available only for the exact internal `U.Transfer` occurrence of one TFS. A cross-member production, use, evaluation, feedback, correspondence, dependency or supply occurrence keeps the kind and semantics returned by its direct owner; E.18.3 never relabels it as universal transfer.

`subjectUse` records a separately current use only when its direct evidence, assurance, architecture, narrative or publication owner has returned the cited exact claim or relation. The classifier alone establishes none of those uses. One occurrence may truthfully have a structural function and support a separate use without becoming two occurrences. For example, one exact crossing occurrence may also support an evidence use only when the evidence owner has returned the cited exact use claim; `structuralFunction=crossing` and `subjectUse=evidence` neither duplicate the occurrence nor make the evidence claim obtain.

For a selected network mapping, resolve `NetworkCrossFlowRelationRowRef` to exactly one row in its named current record edition. Then require that row, the relation-reference episteme and the direct occurrence to agree on exact occurrence, kind, governor, signature and participant order, endpoint members, positions and bindings. The endpoint set adds no relation and makes none obtain; it preserves how the already-obtaining occurrence reaches admitted transformation positions.

A governing-pattern identifier or reference is not a `U.MethodDescription`. A relation signature is carried only when the direct declaration exists and this receiving episteme needs it; citation does not make every use signature-dependent.

#### E.18.3:4.1 - Connections to positions governed elsewhere

E.18.3 mints no universal “governing-pattern position relation”. A neighboring Method, plan, Work, evidence, assurance, gate, decision, architecture, narrative, publication, evaluation or currentness value remains an independently governed constituent or use. A positive connection exists only through an exact already-obtaining relation supplied by its direct owner.

Use this display row when a reader must recover the connection:

```text
neighboringPositionUseRow:
  admittedTransformationPositionLocator: exact CGUSPositionLocator already used by this E.18.3-qualified structure
  neighborPositionKindRef
  neighborPositionRef
  neighborDirectGoverningPatternRef: exact identifier or reference
  connectionQuestion: basis dependency | result | governing constraint | comparison | other stated question
  exactSupportingRelationOccurrenceRef
  supportingRelationReferenceEpistemeRef?: ordinary C.2.1 episteme from 4.0a
  connectionRationaleClaimRef
```

The connection-question values are Plain prompts, not kinds or relations. `basis dependency` creates no obligation. `result` is positive only after the exact result entity or relation and what it is a result of or for are recovered. `governing constraint` needs the exact current constraint claim or occurrence. `comparison` needs its comparator, participants, scope and direct comparison owner; juxtaposition supplies none. Direction, participant order, applicability, occurrence identity, dependence and currentness come from the exact supporting relation and its owner, not from this display row.

An ordinary stop or return uses `stopCondition` or `governingPatternReturnConditions[]` and creates no connection relation by itself. If the direct supporting relation is missing, keep the neighboring values separate, record the attempted question and return the exact `missing-governor`, unresolved-facts, false-predicate or missing-binding result. Recommendation, intended realization, rationale text, common EntityOfConcern and graph adjacency are not substitutes.

#### E.18.3:4.2 - Provisional flow demonstration and admitted slice

Before the selected A.22 structure passes admission and the E.18.3 membership condition, a path fragment, flow card, worked example, replay or first-use explanation remains an ordinary C.2.1 provisional episteme. Its exact EntityOfConcern is the actual transformation subject, current question or proposed continuation set, never a not-yet-admitted structure. Its ClaimContent may name visible candidate positions, proposed relations, possible continuations, presentation form, every unresolved coordinate and the exact condition that would resolve each one. These claims guide discovery but create no constituent, structure identity, position, relation occurrence, Method, MethodDescription, plan, Work or Transformation.

After admission, a separate ordinary C.2.1 demonstrative-slice episteme may teach one admissible traversal. Its exact EntityOfConcern is the same selected CGUS recognized by E.18.3. Its ClaimContent cites exact admitted `CGUSPositionLocator` values, already-admitted relation-reference epistemes or obtaining occurrence refs, relevant C.33 omissions, alternatives, loop-compression and presentation-ordering claims, admissible and forbidden uses, and the slice return condition. A source provisional episteme is cited only through an exact source, derivation or viewing-construction relation under its direct owner; file history is not such a relation.

Do not infer that demonstrated order is project-work order. If ordered Work is current, apply A.15.2 or the direct Method and MethodDescription patterns to independently identified objects and claims; the demonstration’s imperative or repeated wording admits none. Do not infer that a demonstrated path is the whole topology. When the selected structure branches, joins, cycles, keeps alternatives live or is partially ordered, record what the slice omits or compresses before relying on it for comparison, architecture, evidence or planning.

A pre-admission card can still help slot discovery. Each candidate position names the subject-domain object or question it concerns, the proposed E.18 position and binding, and the exact admission coordinate still unresolved. Once the A.22 identity, flow case, admitted position mappings, exact relations, constraints, preserved/lost structure and use boundaries are recoverable, admit the structure first and constitute a separate slice second. If later inspection invalidates admission, withdraw the slice claim while retaining any still-truthful provisional claim under its narrower use.

#### E.18.3:4.2a - Admit network-aware demonstration mappings

A network-aware demonstrative slice is post-admission only. First select and verify one E.18.NET-conforming network. Then recover the one selected A.22.CGUS, its E.18.3 transformation-position mapping rows, and every required relation-reference episteme. Only then may the slice use A.22.CGUS `networkDemonstrationLocator`; the locator supplies no missing member, position, relation, constraint or admission.

For each `selectedNetworkPositionMappingRows[]` entry, resolve the finite member path hop by hop through exact direct members to its leaf TFS. A `FlowPositionRef` must name that final TFS. An `ExposedFlowPositionRef` must name this slice’s selected network and repeat the same complete member path and leaf position; a different network, path or leaf leaves the mapping out. `admittedIncludedPositionLocator` must be the same exact `CGUSPositionLocator` already present in the E.18.3 position mapping and the slice’s `includedPositionLocators[]`. The network ref locates that admitted position; it does not create a copied raw-position list.

For each `selectedCrossFlowRelationReferenceRows[]` entry, require its `NetworkCrossFlowRelationRowRef` to name a current record edition whose EntityOfConcern is this slice’s selected network, then resolve exactly one row by occurrence and complete ordered endpoint-binding identity. Pair that row with one relation-reference episteme already cited by this E.18.3-qualified structure and with its matching `networkEndpointBindingSets[]` entry. Verify occurrence, kind, direct governor, signature, participant order, endpoint members, flow positions and bindings by value. If the record describes another network, zero or several rows resolve, any field differs, or the relation reference is not already current, omit the mapping and return the exact missing or ambiguous network, row, position, occurrence, governor or binding.

The complete top-level one-TFS locator is absent from a network slice. `FlowValuation`, `PathSliceId` and `DesignRunTag` remain member- or leaf-local; Work, actual transformations, boundaries and currentness also remain with their exact member and direct owner. Member paths are finite and membership is acyclic, while exact cross-flow feedback occurrences may cycle when their direct patterns permit them.

Every selected cross-flow relation remains the exact occurrence admitted by its direct owner. Do not substitute universal `creates`, `produces`, `uses`, `input`, `output`, `result`, `handoff` or `transfer` edges. One C.32.CONWAY result may contribute one exact transformer-role-system and transformed-holon architecture-correspondence occurrence as one qualified network row after its occurrence and endpoint bindings are recovered; it never constitutes the network.

A source phrase or graph enters only through an exact source-to-use claim or relation. A separately identified `BoundedModelUseStructure` participates only when the receiving assertion or use selects it and its organization changes interpretation of that claim; shared wording, adjacency or a crossing display establishes neither model-use qualification nor crossing.

**Positive case.** A four-level build-the-builder demonstration follows one finite member path to an already admitted leaf position, maps it to the same included CGUS/E.18.3 locator, cites one exact admitted cross-flow relation-reference episteme, and keeps path slice and tag in one leaf-local row. **Near miss.** A graph supplies raw positions or an edge label, mixes locator families, duplicates positions, assigns one tag to the network or cites a row without exact bindings; keep it provisional or return the exact missing member, relation, position or binding.

#### E.18.3:4.3 - Boundary

E.18.3 recognizes one selected A.22.CGUS `U.Structure`; it is not a second transformation ontology or reciprocal narrower structure. The selected structure is not a workflow, Method, MethodDescription, WorkPlan, performed Work, actual Transformation, mathematical graph, publication, evidence relation, gate decision, architecture decision or architecture description. It organizes independently governed constituents, already-obtaining relations and constraints for one transformation-flow unfolding use.

A graph, record, filled table, demonstration, imperative, selected continuation, recommendation or intended realization establishes neither the A.22 identity nor the E.18.3 condition. It admits no MethodDescription or Work. A.3.2, A.15.1, A.3.4, A.15.PROD and every direct relation owner remain mandatory for those claims.

#### E.18.3:4.4 - Replay and change localization

Replay one use from the selected structure’s exact four A.22 identity discriminators, the current flow-case classification, transformation subjects, admitted position mappings, exact selected relation occurrences and relation-reference epistemes, constraints and guards, neighboring direct relations, one-TFS path/valuation refs when current, any post-admission network mappings, preserved structures, C.33 adequacy notes, and ordinary stop and conditional returns. For each continuation, recover the exact occurrence or guard that admits it and the direct owner of every stronger claim.

Localize changes by the object they affect. A changed relation occurrence reopens its reference episteme, dependent guards and continuations. A changed neighboring object or direct relation reopens only that use row. A changed path or valuation reopens only dependent one-TFS slices and demonstrations. A changed network member, path, exposure, row or endpoint binding returns first to E.18.NET and then to dependent mappings. Changed omitted structure reopens its C.33 episteme. Source edition, source-use, freshness, telemetry and decay remain with their exact owners and G.11; E.18 owns only one-TFS slice-local refresh.

Re-evaluate E.18.3 qualification when its flow case, position mapping or use claim changes. Reidentify the selected `U.Structure` only when one of the four A.22 discriminators changes; a changed description, demonstration, valuation, path slice, local tag or E.18.3 qualification result does not by itself create another structure.

### E.18.3:5 - Worked Slices

**Minimal first use.** In the candidate-set repair situation, name one proposed selected structure use, `CandidateSetComparisonBasis@Review-2026-07` and its kind, then describe candidate `ReferenceEditionChangePosition` and `ComparisonRecalculationPosition` plus the proposed dependency `ComparisonDependsOnAdmittedEdition`. Keep the result as an ordinary C.2.1 provisional episteme whose EntityOfConcern is that comparison-basis question. Its ClaimContent points to G.11 and A.19.CPM as returns and states that the A.22 identity, exact E.18 bindings and dependency occurrence remain unresolved. This already prevents a stale-edition comparison from looking current without asserting a structure, typed position or relation prematurely.

**P2W carry-through.** Accepted problem-side records may name distinctions, constraints and unresolved relation positions that guide later Method selection, planning, Work, interpretation and return. E.18.3 may organize independently current objects only after the selected A.22 structure, E.18 position bindings and direct relations are recovered. It does not authorize launch or performed Work, does not admit any MethodDescription from intended use, and does not replace E.18.1 carry-through.

**Recursive build-the-builder demonstration.** After a four-level network is selected and verified under E.18.NET and the relevant E.18.3 position mappings and relation-reference epistemes are current, a demonstrative slice follows one finite member path to an already admitted leaf position. The network mapping points to the same included `CGUSPositionLocator`, and every cross-member row cites an already-current relation-reference episteme with matching participant positions and bindings. The leaf path slice and tag stay in its member-local row. Before those facts are recovered, the same graph remains a provisional episteme rather than a network-aware slice.

**Transformation-flow mini-example.** A team has a flow card “admitted reference-publication edition changes -> recalculate comparison -> update candidate set -> decide whether to repair.” The card becomes a demonstration only after this exact selected-structure and use account is current:

```text

```

The block is a recovery display, not another record or identity tuple. Before its selected occurrences, position bindings, C.33 omission and returns are recoverable, the flow card remains provisional. After admission, its demonstration ref names a separate episteme about the same selected structure.

**Local edition-relation repair.** `G.11` admits `ReferencePublicationEdition@v2` while `ComparisonDependsOnAdmittedEdition` still references v1. Keep independently unchanged constituents, positions, path and path-slice identifiers, preserved structures and return conditions. Reapply the relation’s direct owner, replace the selected occurrence only if the v2 predicate obtains, and then re-evaluate `EditionAdmissionGuard`. Reopen the A.19.CPM comparison use only if its basis changed, C.18 only if the comparison result changed, and C.32.PAD only if that retained-set change affects the current decision. If the selected occurrence changes, the A.22 relation discriminator changes and the selected structure must be reidentified; mere publication wording or a new relation-reference episteme does not do so.

**Connected-box proxy failure.** A team reports that every flow-card box is connected and adds low-value edges until path coverage reaches its target. The relation count rises, but guards no longer distinguish admissible alternatives, stale dependencies remain unrepaired and wrong governing-pattern returns increase. Edge count and path coverage describe the expression only. Remove edges without exact direct occurrences, evaluate whether practitioners select the correct guarded continuation and smallest repair, and use `E.13` when display coverage substitutes for those outcomes.

**Architecture P2S projection.** A P2S flow card includes architecture-relevant problem pressure, unknown or selected structures, synthesis positions and actual-structure feedback. If one selected CGUS satisfies E.18.3, cite its exact E.18 positions and relations. `C.32.P2S` owns selected and expected epistemic structures and their exact use; realization Work and actual world-side structures remain separate. `C.30.TFS-REL` owns architecture use and `C.32.PAD` owns an architecture decision. One exact `C.32.CONWAY` correspondence may be one qualified E.18.NET row, never the whole network.

**Physical workpiece transformation.** A heat-treatment unfolding use concerns `GearBlank@Lot-14`, independently admitted as a project `U.Holon`, and selects exact E.18 positions for load, soak, quench and hardness evaluation. `QuenchAdmittedAfterSoakRange` must be an exact current guard occurrence. Furnace loading and quenching remain planned or dated Work under A.15; each actual heat-treatment change remains under A.3.4; any production/inception/completion claim remains under A.15.PROD; hardness remains under its measurement, evaluation and evidence owners. A flow card can expose alternatives before execution without claiming that Work occurred.

**Clinical transformation planning.** A treatment-adjustment unfolding use concerns `Patient@Case-17`, independently admitted as a `U.System`, and selects assessment, intervention-candidate, contraindication-guard, observed-state and return positions. The selected structure may show that one exact observed-state relation changes which intervention remains admissible. It does not authorize treatment, establish evidence sufficiency, replace clinical judgement, admit a MethodDescription or claim that an intervention occurred; those claims remain with their clinical DPF, permission, Work, evidence and gate owners.

**Formal flow-expression boundary.** A team expresses the candidate-set repair use as a directed graph or DCR model to ask whether `DecisionRepairPosition` is reachable after `EditionAdmissionGuard`. The expression may preserve selected dependency and guard topology plus the queried path. It loses subject-use authority, direct governing-pattern connections, C.33 omissions and currentness semantics unless those are separately mapped. Use `E.18.2` for the mathematical description and `C.29` for its declared use, preserved/lost structure and stop. Positive reachability establishes neither currentness, retained-set validity, decision repair, Work order nor selected-structure identity.

**Reference-currentness repair.** A one-TFS path slice may depend on an admitted publication edition, a `G.2` source-use relation, a source pack or a telemetry window. E.18 governs slice-local flow refresh. G.11 governs source currentness, decay, edition shift, deprecation, reship and no-change claims. Connect these values only through exact direct occurrences and reopen the smallest dependent use; do not create a combined currentness-refresh value.

### E.18.3:6 - Bias-Annotation

| Bias risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Path-as-workflow | Restore the selected structure, exact E.18 positions and bindings, already-obtaining relations, guards, preserved/lost structure and direct Work-pattern exits. |
| Graph-as-structure-in-every-sense | Keep graphs and flow cards as provisional C.2.1 epistemes before admission or separate demonstrative epistemes afterward; neither presentation is the governed structure. |
| Profile-as-second-structure | Keep the four A.22 discriminators as the one structure identity. E.18.3 qualification, records, descriptions, locators and reciprocal-looking references create no second structure. |
| One TFS as universal parent | Classify several valuations, one internal `SubflowRef` and independently selected E.18.NET members before using a demonstration. |
| Gate, evidence or subject-use absorption | Keep each direct claim with its owner even when a relation-reference episteme gives the same occurrence a structural-function classification. |
| Intended realization as MethodDescription or Work | Apply the exact A.3.2 membership threshold or A.15.1 occurrence test; pattern refs, imperatives, rows and selected continuations establish neither. |

### E.18.3:7 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Passing condition | Failed-check repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CC-E18.3-1 One selected structure.** | One exact `U.Structure` has the four A.22 identity discriminators and satisfies the E.18.3 transformation-flow condition; no reciprocal generic/narrower structure or ambient-context identity exists. | Recover the A.22 discriminator or keep the artifact provisional. |
| **CC-E18.3-2 Flow case and substrate.** | The E.18 substrate is current; every bounded `U.Transformation` binding used by it was independently grounded under A.3.4; transformation subjects and kinds are exact; and the use is classified as several valuations on one TFS, one internal `SubflowRef`, or one E.18.NET network over independent members and exact crossings. | Recover the missing transformation or binding; remove valuation-created flows, detail-created members and giant-flow flattening; return to E.18 or E.18.NET. |
| **CC-E18.3-2a Position admission.** | Every transformation position maps the same exact admitted `CGUSPositionLocator` through an exact `FlowPositionRef` and binding; a network position additionally agrees with the selected network, complete member path and leaf TFS. No raw parallel position list exists. | Return the mismatched structure, TFS, network, path, leaf, constituent or binding; admit the missing position or keep it provisional. |
| **CC-E18.3-2b Relation and local state.** | Every transfer, dependency, crossing or guard occurrence is already admitted by its direct owner. A relation-reference episteme has that occurrence as EntityOfConcern and agrees in kind, governor, signature when current, participant order and any network endpoint bindings. Valuations, slices and tags remain TFS- or leaf-local. | Return the exact governor, predicate, facts, occurrence, record, endpoint or binding blocker; remove global state or ungrounded edges. |
| **CC-E18.3-3 Neighboring positions.** | Every positive dependency, result, constraint or comparison connection names the exact neighbor kind and ref, direct governor, question, rationale and an already-obtaining supporting relation with its participants, direction and identity. Stops and returns remain use conditions unless separately admitted as relations. | Keep the objects separate, record the attempted question and return the exact direct-owner result. |
| **CC-E18.3-4 Preserved and omitted structure.** | Preserved structures are exact refs; captured, expected-but-uncaptured, lost or hidden structure needed by the use is stated in exact C.33 epistemes. | Add the exact structures and C.33 claims or narrow the use. |
| **CC-E18.3-5 Stop, return and currentness.** | Ordinary stop and conditional returns to exact patterns are separate. E.18 one-TFS refresh, E.18.NET member/network change and G.11 source currentness remain distinct. | Add the exact boundary or keep a one-use explanation. |
| **CC-E18.3-6 Non-chain topology.** | Branches, joins, cycles, partial orders and guarded alternatives are preserved or explicitly omitted. Membership is acyclic; directly governed feedback relations may cycle. | Keep a linear path provisional or state its exact loss in the post-admission slice. |
| **CC-E18.3-7 Demonstration separation.** | Provisional, whole-structure-description and demonstrative uses remain ordinary C.2.1 epistemes separate from the selected structure. One-TFS and network locator families are complete and mutually exclusive. | Reconstitute the correct episteme, remove mixed locators and admit structure before demonstration. |
| **CC-E18.3-8 Method and Work threshold.** | Governing-pattern refs, intended realization, recommendations, imperatives, displayed order and table completion admit no MethodDescription, Method, plan, Work or actual Transformation. A.3.2, A.15.1 and A.3.4 are applied to exact independent objects when those claims are current. | Apply the direct threshold or narrow the claim. |
| **CC-E18.3-9 Plain move and no hidden mantra.** | `move` denotes the exact current pattern-use action or independently governed object. The seven application steps remain guidance, not a mantra, Method, plan or performed sequence. | Replace the generic move/step reading with the exact object and owner. |

### E.18.3:8 - Common Anti-Patterns And Repairs

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **P2W as launch permission** | A carry-through note or selected continuation is used to begin Work. | Apply the exact Method, A.15.2 plan, A.15.5 readiness, A.21 gate or permission owner required by the claim; none alone performs Work. |
| **Flow card as architecture decision** | A P2S flow card is treated as the decision or ADR. | Keep flow use in E.18.3 or C.32.P2S; use `C.32.PAD` and `C.32.ADR` for their exact distinct objects. |
| **Parallel specialization object** | Reciprocal refs, a context field or profile record create a generic CGUS plus another E.18.3 structure. | Keep one selected A.22 `U.Structure` and treat E.18.3 as an additional membership-and-use condition. |
| **Network graph as admitted slice** | Raw paths, edge labels, copied positions or one global tag are inserted into a demonstration. | Select E.18.NET first, then reuse the same admitted CGUS locators and relation-reference epistemes through the complete A.22 network locator. |
| **One giant flow** | Independent development, production, use or evaluation flows are merged because a product or arrow connects them. | Preserve member identity and use exact cross-boundary occurrences in E.18.NET; keep valuations and internal subflow detail on one TFS. |
| **Wrapper connection relation** | `basisDependency`, `producedResult`, `comparisonPeer` or a return arrow is treated as a universal E.18.3 relation. | State the exact question and use its direct relation owner; otherwise keep the values separate and stop. |
| **Evidence path as evidence** | A path through evidence-looking boxes or a `subjectUse=evidence` label is treated as sufficient evidence. | Open `A.10`, `B.3` or `G.6` and cite the exact returned claim or relation. |
| **Intended realization as MethodDescription or Work** | A pattern ref, sequence, recommendation, imperative or filled block is said to describe a Method or perform the continuation. | Apply A.3.2 to an episteme about one admitted Method and A.15.1 to an exact dated occurrence; otherwise retain only the cue. |
| **Loop as improvement** | A retry or feedback loop is called quality improvement. | Use `E.23` only when object version, evaluation frame, repair, re-evaluation, stop, branch and return are current. |

### E.18.3:9 - Consequences

This profile lets E.18 keep its strength without swallowing every route-shaped pattern. P2W, P2S, agent-loop, gate, evidence, architecture and currentness cases may use the same selected A.22 structure and exact transformation-flow relations while each subject claim remains governed by its direct pattern.

The cost is explicit recovery. A selected CGUS qualifies for E.18.3 only when its E.18 or E.18.NET case, subject rows, admitted position mappings, exact selected occurrences, guards, preserved/lost structure and direct exits are recoverable. Before that, the visible episteme remains provisional; only afterward may a separate demonstrative episteme present one traversal.

The benefit is change locality. A changed demonstration, valuation, path slice or tag usually changes only that use; it does not reidentify the selected structure. A changed selected constituent, occurrence, applied constraint or named selection-use frame changes an A.22 discriminator and therefore requires a different structure selection.

### E.18.3:10 - Rationale

The design follows the same principle as E.18: transformation-flow structure is structure, not the whole work process. Constraint-governed unfolding adds a next-use concern—how one selected structure exposes admissible continuations while protecting the differences among structure, description, Method, MethodDescription, plan, Work, transformation, production, evidence, gate, decision, architecture, publication, E.18 slice-local refresh and G.11 currentness.

E.18.3 stays deliberately thin. It does not create a reciprocal specialization object or universal connection relation. It recognizes one A.22-selected `U.Structure` when exact E.18 positions, direct relation occurrences and transformation-flow constraints support the current unfolding use, and it uses ordinary C.2.1 epistemes only to make that qualification and its demonstrations replayable.

| Exact source or practice anchor | FPF adoption | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OMG, *Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) Version 1.1*, December 2016 | Use as lineage for weakly structured case-work slices whose positions and relations are constrained without one fixed work order. | CMMN is not treated as current best-known process practice.

| Esser and Fahland, "OCPQ: Object-Centric Process Querying & Constraints", arXiv:2506.11541, 2025 | Adopt the current object-centric pressure that typed objects and their relations jointly determine constraint queries. This reinforces multi-object flow positions, joins, many-to-many dependencies, and exact relation-preserving returns. | OCPQ governs event-data queries and constraint checking. E.18.3 does not import event-log, query-language, or process-mining ontology, and an OCPQ result does not become transformation-flow structure. |

It does not govern the physical model, solver semantics, compiler semantics, analysis result, or AI-agent edit. |
| Ma, Gowda, Anantharaman, Laughman, Shah, and Rackauckas, "ModelingToolkit: A Composable Graph Transformation System For Equation-Based Modeling", arXiv:2103.05244; Rackauckas et al., "Composing Modeling and Simulation with Machine Learning in Julia", arXiv:2105.05946; Functional Mock-up Interface standard | Use these model-toolchain sources to keep symbolic model structure, graph transformations, calibration analyses, surrogate components, exchange packages, and result publications as exact separately governed values connected through transformation-flow relations. | E.18.3 does not prove mathematical adequacy, domain validity, evidence readiness, source currentness, or publication truth. Those claims leave to `C.29`, domain DPF patterns, evidence patterns, `G.11`, or publication patterns. |
| Current FPF `E.18`, `E.23`, `C.18`, `C.19`, and `G.11` practice | Use local path slices, feedback relations, candidate-population stewardship, and currentness returns as separately governed structure positions rather than one master process. | Architecture, work, evidence, improvement, archive, front, pool, E.18 slice-local refresh, and G.11 currentness claims remain governed by their direct patterns. |

As of 2026-07-11, OCPQ is the current research comparator for typed multi-object constraint structure, while Modelica 3.7 and Dyad 3.1.0 are current engineering comparators for relation-first models separated from analyses and execution. The older CMMN, Declare, DCR, and artifact-centric rows supply lineage. These source decisions changed `4.0` by requiring exact typed relations before continuation, `4.1` by keeping separately governed positions explicit, `4.2` by preserving graph-shaped alternatives behind a linear demonstration, and the physical case by separating structure from work and analysis. Reopen the adoptions when object-centric constraint methods change object-relation treatment, model languages change model-analysis separation, or use evidence shows that these distinctions no longer prevent workflow, query-result, or execution-artifact overread.

### E.18.3:12 - Relations

Specializes: the A.22.CGUS use of one selected `U.Structure` when the same exact constituents, selected obtaining relation occurrences, applied constraints and named selection-use frame also satisfy the transformation-flow unfolding condition through exact E.18 positions and bindings. E.18.3 creates no second structure or ambient context identity.

Builds on: `E.18` for one-TFS positions, internal `U.Transfer` occurrences, valuations, paths, slices and `SubflowRef`; `E.18.NET` for independently selected TFS or nested-network members, finite member paths, exposed positions and exact obtaining cross-member occurrences; `A.22.CGUS` for position locators, provisional/description/demonstrative episteme separation and mutually exclusive post-admission locator families; `A.3.4`, `A.22` and `E.17` for transformation, structure and publication discipline.

Coordinates with: `E.18.1`, `C.32.P2S`, `C.30.TFS-REL`, `C.32.CONWAY`, `E.23`, `C.18`, `C.19`, `G.5`, `A.15`, `A.15.PROD`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `A.6.3.NAR`, exact source-use patterns and `G.11`. A network demonstration consumes only already-current E.18.3 position mappings and relation-reference epistemes; one C.32.CONWAY occurrence can fill at most one qualified network row.

Does not replace: the direct Method, MethodDescription, Work, transformation, production, evidence, assurance, gate, architecture, decision, publication, mathematical-lens, source-use, E.18 slice-local refresh or G.11 currentness patterns. Pattern refs, selected continuations, imperative wording, graph adjacency and intended realization admit none of those objects.
