## E.10.ARCH - Wording-Use Ontological Precision Restoration Architecture

> **Type:** Architectural (E)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative

**Plain-name.** Wording ontology repair architecture.

**Intent.**
Keep FPF wording-use precision restoration distributed without letting every pattern of concern or subject pattern grow its own first-stage wording-recognition table. `E.10` recognizes overloaded wording use; `E.10.ARCH` says which applicability rows exist, how one row selects the first applicable restoration or governing pattern, and when repeated repair-only prose should be extracted from a subject pattern.

`E.10.ARCH` is not a generic language-cleanup pattern. Its mechanism is ontological reconstruction: recover the current governed object, the exact use that made the wording consequential, and the pattern governing that object or use. Recover a claim-bearing episteme, publication object, source-relation disposition, state-family value, or mathematical lens only when that object is current. The output returns to wording after those objects and their direct relations are recoverable. When the kind is recoverable but phrase-level apparatus still hides it, use `F.19` for ontology-first plain technical rewriting.

**Relation-use recovery rule.** When wording hides a positive or governed-negative direct relation claim, first name the direct relation kind, its actual participants under their relation-participant meanings, and the direct pattern governing predicate obtaining and occurrence identity. Add a `RelationSignature` and `SlotSpec` only when reusable typed declaration is current. Add an assertion or description episteme and its relation-participant designations only when a current claim needs them. Individuate one relation occurrence only when a named receiving use needs to distinguish it. If recovery instead returns an exact `A.6.1` operation-application binding, a local `A.15.PROD` or `A.6.RCD` claim, or reason-specific non-assertability, keep that result under its direct owner and do not coerce it into a relation kind or occurrence. `E.10.ARCH` introduces no generic relation record, relation position, ontic slot, or filler.

**Use this pattern when** a recurring wording-use problem hides stable ontological recovery work that should be shared instead of copied into each subject pattern.

**What goes wrong if missed.** Subject patterns accumulate local wording-repair catalogues and stop foregrounding their own governed object, invariant, and first useful move.

**What this pattern buys.** One distribution architecture keeps recognition in `E.10`, recovery architecture in `E.10.ARCH`, and object-specific ontology in the direct governing or realization pattern.

**Rationale.** Precision restoration needs an ontology-first distribution rule because a recurring trigger word may hide different governed objects, direct relations and participants, declaration-local `SlotSpec` values, claim-bearing epistemes, publication objects, or mathematical lenses in different places.

**SoTA-Echoing.** The pattern follows FPF's current ontology-first restoration practice: typed object recovery, direct governing-pattern use when available, and thin pointers in subject patterns instead of repeated repair doctrine.

**Builds on.** `E.10`, `A.6.P`, `A.6.P.WMR`, `A.6.RCD`, `A.6.F`, `C.2.P`, `C.2.P.DR`, `C.30.STRAT`, `A.19.SPR`, `A.6.3.CSC`, `A.3.1`, `A.3.2`, `A.6.0`, `A.6.1`, `E.20`, `A.15.PROD`, `E.24`, `E.24.CD`, `E.24.PUB`, `F.18`, `E.8`, `E.19`, and `E.2`.

**Coordinates with.** `A.22`, `C.30`, `C.30.P`, `C.30.STRAT`, `C.30.ASV`, named `C.30.*` structure or view patterns, `C.16`, `A.17`, `A.18`, `A.19`, `C.25`, `C.27.TA`, `C.27`, `C.29`, `A.3.1`, `A.3.2`, `A.3.3`, `A.3.4`, `A.6.0`, `A.6.1`, `A.6.P.WMR`, `E.18`, `E.20`, `A.15.PROD`, `E.24`, `E.24.CD`, `E.24.PUB`, `A.15.2`, `A.15.1`, `A.10`, `F.19`, `E.21`, `E.11`, `I.2`, and evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, causal-use, release, and publication patterns governing those claims when those claims are being made.

### E.10.ARCH:0 - Use This When

Use this pattern when a recurring FPF-governed wording-use problem cannot be closed by one local `E.10` rewrite because the wording hides a stable primary-EntityOfConcern use field set, a stable recovery shape, and a useful remaining reader use.

**Early failure cue.** FPF accumulates many small local wording-recognition lists, and subject patterns start teaching repair doctrine instead of their own EntityOfConcern, invariants, and first useful move.

**Early gain cue.** `E.10.ARCH` gives one architecture for distributing wording-use repair: `E.10` recognizes the row, this pattern selects the recovery architecture, and the governing subject pattern stays centered on its own object.

Use it especially when a subject or adequacy pattern contains repeated first-stage repair prose such as:

- architecture-vs-diagram, model, graph, ADR, dashboard, view, layer, level, tier, stack, block, expert, cache, router, or gate triage before the architecture, structure, control, module-interface, flow, scale, publication, or gate pattern can state its own invariant;
- axis, dimension, feature, property, metric, indicator, score, strong, weak, robust, level, coordinate, threshold, or scalar-quality triage before a characteristic or scale pattern can state its own invariant;
- quality-term repair that decides between relation construction, quality characterization, evaluative characterization, Q-bundle use, pattern-quality coordinate use, action invitation, bridge, or governing pattern;
- state-family wording such as state, status, posture, readiness, stance, or currentness before the bearer, state frame, value set, admissible use, or governing pattern is recovered;
- admissibility-like, legal, lawful, authority, validity, readiness, pass-looking, fail-looking, or conformance wording before bearer, claim kind, source relation, value frame, bounded use, and direct governing pattern are recovered;
- method, algorithm, program, proof, solver, workflow, process, procedure, access path, query plan, control strategy, or programming-paradigm wording before the current method, work, mechanism, or description object, exact direct relation use, claim-bearing episteme, representation use, and governing pattern are recovered;
- input, raw-material, source-data, source-material, output, result, outcome, deliverable, handoff, or work-name wording before the exact entity, related object, four orthogonal claim dimensions (claim subject; modality and exact temporal extent; polarity; recovery/support state), governor or reason-specific non-assertability basis, and any performed-work occurrence basis are recovered;
- relation, signature, interface, role, assignment, enactment, slot, field, parameter, argument, endpoint, port, API, protocol, connector, capability, affordance, method, function, concern, or interest wording before the current governed object or claim kind is recovered and before the direct governing pattern can carry the recovered claim;

- graph, path, query, table, dashboard, checklist predicate, publication face, evidence-path wording, or pattern-relation wording overread as a route, call, dispatch, invocation, work sequence, permission, release, evidence result, or pattern application;
- source, publication, publication form, face, `PublicationUnit`, dashboard, documentation, or source-return wording whose project-side use is not yet recovered;
- relation-like, function-like, evidence-like, assurance-like, gate-like, work-like, decision-like, causal-use, release, or naming wording whose governing pattern is already known or must be recovered before the sentence is admitted.

**Failure shape.** FPF accumulates many small local wording-recognition lists. One pattern says "architecture is not a diagram", another says "metric is not proof", another says "quality is not one scalar", another says "a path is not a route", and a reader cannot tell which pattern carries the repair. The text looks more precise, but the reader does not get a stable first move.

**Architecture gain.** `E.10.ARCH` gives one architecture for distributing wording-use repair: `E.10` recognizes the wording-use row; `E.10.ARCH` selects the row and extraction criterion; a realization pattern or governing neighboring pattern recovers the ontology; the governing subject pattern carries its own primary `EntityOfConcern` and first useful move.

**First useful move.** Decide whether the wording can close locally under `E.10`, already has a governing pattern, or needs one applicability row with stable `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, `semanticArea`, `semanticAreaSenseFamily`, `ontologicalNeighborhood`, recovery apparatus, and remaining reader use.

**Not this pattern when.**

- If a sentence is repaired locally under `E.10`, stop there.
- If the governing pattern and current governed object, exact direct relation use, or claim-bearing episteme are already recoverable by value, use that governing pattern directly.
- If the kind under repair is evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, causal-use, release, mathematical-lens use, grounded architecture adequacy, structural-view adequacy, characteristic-space construction, Q-bundle construction, pattern-quality evaluation, method, mechanism, method description, formal substrate, graph path, evidence or provenance relation, publication face, or another FPF kind named by value, the governing pattern governs its own invariant. `E.10.ARCH` only governs the wording-use restoration distribution.
- If the wording problem is phrase-level apparatus around an already recoverable kind, use `F.19` rather than creating a new wording-use restoration row.

### E.10.ARCH:0.1 - Problem Frame

Precision restoration in FPF is ontology-first, not word-substitution-first. A recurring wording family is important only when it hides a stable governed object, direct relation kind, actual participant or relation-participant meaning, declaration-local `SlotSpec`, assertion-side participant designation, claim kind, publication-use relation, source-relation disposition, mathematical lens, or neighboring-pattern boundary.

### E.10.ARCH:0.2 - Problem

Without a shared distribution architecture, subject patterns collect first-stage repair catalogues and lose their object focus. The same false friend is then repaired differently in architecture, characteristic, evidence, publication, method, relation, and state-family patterns.

### E.10.ARCH:0.3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Shared repair vs subject-pattern focus | FPF needs recurring trigger recognition, but each subject pattern must stay centered on its own EntityOfConcern. |
| Ontology-first repair vs lexical cleanup | The repair must recover kind, slot, relation, and use before choosing wording. |
| Direct governing pattern vs restoration detour | A direct pattern should govern when the object is already recoverable by value. |
| Local cue vs duplicated doctrine | Subject patterns may need one first-use cue, not a copied repair table. |
| Semantic area vs placement nest | A semantic area, ontological neighborhood, and pattern nest are different objects. |

### E.10.ARCH:0.4 - Solution

Use `E.10` for recognition, `E.10.ARCH` for the shared distribution architecture, and a direct governing or realization pattern for the recovered ontology. Add a new applicability row only when the recurring wording hides a stable field set, recovery apparatus, and remaining reader use that no direct governing pattern already carries.

### E.10.ARCH:1 - Primary EntityOfConcern and applicability-row scope

The primary `EntityOfConcern` for this pattern use is the local FPF architecture of `WordingUseRestorationApplicabilityRow` rows.

A `WordingUseRestorationApplicabilityRow` is a pattern-local row over one `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, one `semanticArea`, one `semanticAreaSenseFamily`, one recurring `entityOfConcernUseFields` field set, and one `ontologicalNeighborhood`. It states:

- the trigger source recognized by `E.10`;
- `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, `semanticArea`, and `semanticAreaSenseFamily`;
- the primary `EntityOfConcern` kind and encountered FPF kind or reference;
- the relation between the encountered FPF kind or reference and the primary `EntityOfConcern`;
- the FPF kind or relation named by value recovered when current;
- current-claim or admissible-use classification when current;
- source-relation disposition when current;
- state-family value or governing-pattern result when current;
- sentence function;
- admissible use;
- non-use boundary;
- remaining reader use;
- first applicable restoration or governing pattern;
- recovery product;
- first return to the subject pattern.

`WordingUseRestorationApplicabilityRow` is not a `U.*` kind, not a conformance record, not a process task, not a deontic obligation, and not a durable project record by itself.

`WordingUseRestorationApplicabilityTable` is the pattern-local publication table of such rows. It is not a pattern cluster, workstream, campaign, module, semantic parent, or authority-bearing record.

`semanticAreaBaseConcept` is the Base concept, source wording span, or already settled row cue by which the reader first recognizes the candidate semantic unit.

`semanticArea` is the Part-F semantic unit used by one wording-use restoration row: one Concept-Set row, one UTS row, or an explicitly bounded row-set whose rows remain sense-uniform enough for one recovery apparatus.

`semanticAreaSenseFamily` is the Part-F `senseFamily` or FPF kind named by value-family discriminator that prevents the row from becoming a theme, domain, workstream, or pattern-nest label.

`ontologicalNeighborhood` means the FPF applicability neighborhood around that named `semanticArea`: primary `EntityOfConcern` kind, admissible adjacent FPF kinds or references, relations, descriptions, publication forms or carriers, source-relation dispositions, state-family values, use boundaries, applicable FPF patterns, remaining reader use, and the stable apparatus that makes the recovery checkable. It is not the semantic unit by itself and is not textual proximity, filename proximity, ToC proximity, alphabetic proximity, workstream grouping, topic grouping, discipline column, domain label, or pattern-nest placement.

`pattern nest` means a numbering or placement grouping such as `A.6.*`, `C.16.*`, or `C.30.*`. One applicability row may point to a realization pattern in one pattern nest, but the row and the nest are not the same concept.

### E.10.ARCH:2 - Distribution architecture

The standing construction is:

1. `E.10` recognizes an FPF-governed wording use and either closes it locally or selects a governing pattern, controlled precision-reduction pattern, durable-name application, or fail-closed non-use disposition.
2. `E.10.ARCH` maintains the shared recovery algorithm and the `WordingUseRestorationApplicabilityTable`.
3. A realization pattern or retained governing pattern such as `A.6.RSIR`, `A.6.P`, `A.6.P.WMR`, `A.6.RCD`, `A.6.F`, `C.2.P`, `C.2.P.DR`, `C.30.P`, `C.30.STRAT`, `C.16.P`, `C.16.Q`, `A.19.SPR`, `A.3.1`, or a direct evidence, graph, method, mechanism, work, gate, authority, release, or publication-use governing pattern unpacks the wording according to the shared algorithm for one named `semanticArea` and its `ontologicalNeighborhood`. `A.6.P.WMR` is selected after generic relation recovery when one method/work-boundary claim remains hidden; `A.6.RCD` is selected only after exact participants are recovered and no current direct relation or already governed local relation-bearing claim closes the named receiving claim.
4. Additional applicability rows, and only when needed additional realization patterns, appear when repeated FPF-governed wording hides a stable primary-EntityOfConcern use field set, a stable recovery shape, and a useful remaining reader use that no existing governing pattern already carries.
5. `E.8` governs publication-form and placement wording such as `pattern nest`, and requires authoring prose that uses `ontologicalNeighborhood` to expose the governing `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, `semanticArea`, and `semanticAreaSenseFamily` rather than treating neighborhood as the semantic unit.
6. `E.19` checks that authored pattern hosts preserve this distribution and do not keep rival first-stage repair doctrine.

This architecture keeps `E.10` compact. It also keeps subject patterns centered on their own primary EntityOfConcern values, decisions, characteristics, structures, mathematical lenses, consequences, and worked uses.

#### E.10.ARCH:2.1 - EntityOfConcern and recurring hidden-field distribution

For wording such as `EntityOfInterest`, `EoI`, `EoIClass`, `describedEntity`, `DescribedEntityRef`, and `primary described entity`, or for selected EntityOfConcern-family heads such as `EntityOfConcern`, `entityOfConcernRef`, `EntityOfConcernRef`, `EntityOfConcernClass`, and `publicationUnitPrimaryEntityOfConcern`, the repair is distributed by the current FPF-governed use:

`EntityOfInterest`, `EoI`, `EoIClass`, `describedEntity`, `DescribedEntityRef`, and `primary described entity` are active repair triggers. FPF-governed wording must recover the EntityOfConcern-family use named by value, publication-unit primary-EoC use, or local FPF kind, then rewrite to `EntityOfConcern`, `entityOfConcernRef`, `EntityOfConcernRef`, `EntityOfConcernClass`, `publicationUnitPrimaryEntityOfConcern`, or the local FPF kind named by value. If no use is recoverable by value, the wording remains quoted source or trigger wording and cannot be used for reliance.

- `C.2.1` governs episteme identity and the identified `EntityOfConcern` participant of `EpistemeConstitutionRelation`; `A.6.5` governs `EntityOfConcernSlot` only inside a reusable constitution `RelationSignature`; direct reference patterns govern `entityOfConcernRef`, `EntityOfConcernRef`, and related reference use.
- `C.2.P` carries episteme, publication, source-wording, and source-relation precision restoration when the sentence still hides source wording, claim-bearing episteme, publication construction, publication-form construction, project-side reliance, pattern-application wording, or use or non-use disposition.
- `F.18` carries durable naming, selected head settlement, and source-string and durable-name discipline after the kind under repair and use are recovered.
- `E.17.AUD.OOTD` carries `publicationUnitPrimaryEntityOfConcern` for one bounded publication unit with one carried move and one outside-work boundary; that publication-use designation adds no participant to `EpistemeConstitutionRelation`.
- `A.6.3`, its retained `entityOfConcernRef`-preserving specializations, and `A.6.4` carry preservation or retargeting of the EntityOfConcern across episteme morphisms.
- Evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, architecture, characteristic, mathematical-lens, or project-side patterns govern their own claim being made or admissible-use boundary directly when it is already recoverable.

This selected-family case is the standing example for recurring hidden-field architecture. When a new hidden-field family recurs, it is not solved by adding local warning prose to every subject pattern. It either uses an existing governing pattern, gets one applicability row in this table, or justifies a new realization pattern only when the hidden field set, recovery apparatus, and remaining reader use recur across FPF-governed texts.

#### E.10.ARCH:2.2 - Ontic-Level and Facet-Level Restoration Distribution

Use this distribution before adding or specializing a wording-use precision-restoration pattern.

`E.10` is the shared recognition scan. It recognizes an FPF-governed wording-use problem and selects the first applicable restoration or governing pattern. `E.10.ARCH` owns the distribution rule. A specialized restoration pattern owns only the stable ontological recovery for one selected ontic, semantic area, or high-pressure facet.

Use a direct governing pattern when the current governed object, exact direct relation use, claim-bearing episteme, representation use, or claim kind is already recoverable by value. A direct `A.3.4`, `A.6.F`, `C.29`, `E.18`, `C.30`, `A.15`, `A.10`, gate, decision, publication, or evidence use does not need a restoration detour only because a familiar trigger word appears.

`A.6.RSIR` is the selected first-level realization pattern for the relation-signature-interface-role-slot cluster. Use it only when wording such as relation, signature, interface, role, assignment, enactment, slot, field, parameter, argument, endpoint, port, API, protocol, connector, capability, affordance, method, function, concern, or interest hides which governed object or claim kind is current. The first-level product is not a new ontology; it is a compact recovery of project concern, current EntityOfConcern or claim kind, selected direct governing pattern, slot-discipline need, retained source-label use, and blocked overread. After that selection, the direct pattern owns the repair.


Use an ontic-level restoration pattern only when recurring wording hides a candidate durable ontology unit whose primary governed subject kind, stable identity, core direct relation, named neighboring direct relations, and governing patterns need joint recovery before wording repair. The restoration recovers the exact current governed objects and direct relation uses; it does not treat declaration-local SlotKinds or assertion-side participant designations as parts of the ontic.

Use `E.24.CD` only when recurring wording exposes a candidate subject that may need an E.24 ontic-introduction decision: a potential primary governed subject kind, stable identity, core direct relation, named neighboring direct relations, and action-facing gain that no direct governing pattern already carries. Use `E.24.PUB` only when the repair must distinguish ontic, ontic-description episteme, publication form, view, record, card, table, schema, data-structure expression, rendering, or source relation. If the subject ontology is already governed by a pattern such as `A.22`, `A.19`, `C.30`, `A.3.4`, or `C.2.1`, use that pattern directly and cite `E.24.CD` or `E.24.PUB` only as the relevant thin boundary reference.

Use a facet-level restoration pattern only when one recurring facet cuts across several ontics or subject patterns and has its own stable ambiguity. Function-like wording under `A.6.F` is the standing example: function wording may point to transformation behavior, performed-work action or another actor-side claim under an exact direct governor, a separately typed architecture or other influence source under its exact relation, mathematical function, module allocation, capability, quality, role, work, method, evidence, assurance, gate, or decision. That facet is too broad to duplicate inside every ontic-level restoration pattern and too specific to leave as ordinary prose.

Do not create one precision-restoration pattern per relation-participant meaning or declaration-local SlotKind. A separate restoration pattern is justified only when the same ambiguity recurs across several patterns, changes the governing FPF kind or direct relation use, and would otherwise force subject patterns to carry repeated first-stage repair prose. Otherwise, apply the direct relation pattern and, when reusable declaration is current, `A.6.5`.

When both an ontic-level restoration pattern and a facet restoration pattern are applicable, apply them by recovered question, not by word order. The ontic-level pattern asks which candidate subject, governed objects, core and neighboring direct relations, and governing patterns are current. The facet pattern asks how the overloaded facet word is assigned after that recovery. For example, transformation wording that includes `function`, `functional`, or `functioning` may use a transformation-ontic restoration pattern to recover `U.Transformation`, `TransformationFlowStructure`, its exact participants and direct relations, or `FunctioningRef?`; detailed function-kind discrimination remains with `A.6.F`.

A conforming specialized restoration pattern states:

- the ontic, semantic area, or facet-neighborhood under repair;
- the recognition wording family selected by `E.10`;
- the recovered governed object, any exact direct relation use, any current claim-bearing episteme or representation, and the pattern governing each;
- any direct governing pattern that should apply instead when the value is already recoverable;
- any facet restoration pattern that owns a narrower recurring ambiguity;
- the temporary recovery product and the retained user-facing move after wording repair.

### E.10.ARCH:3 - Shared recovery algorithm

#### E.10.ARCH:3.1 - Method, work, and P2W governing-pattern constellation in wording restoration

Use this branch when one source label, project handle, or project concern points to changing, producing, selecting, deriving, controlling, or maintaining an `EntityOfConcern` rather than to one typed FPF value.

Do not name a new recovery object. Recover the project concern first to find the linked direct relations and independently governed entities. Then recover the typed FPF values separately through their governing patterns. Typical values include `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription`, `U.Mechanism`, formal-substrate declaration, mathematical-lens use, `U.WorkPlan`, a dated Work occurrence admitted under `U.Work`, evidence relation, source relation, gate relation, exact direct subject relation for a changed referent, measurement-result episteme, evaluation result, `C.11` `ChoiceResult` or decision record, publication relation, and temporal relation when current.

When the recovered project concern is not one method but a relation among methods or method families, recover `MethodRelationStructure@BoundedContext`: serial composition, parallel composition, guarded choice, iteration, refinement, substitution, decomposition, parameterization, method-family membership, selector relation, fallback relation, or another method-side relation. Govern it through `A.3.1`, `A.3.2`, `A.15`, `G.5`, or a direct method-composition pattern when current. Treat algebraic, graph, categorical, process-calculus, effect-calculus, matrix, embedding, distributed, or neural notation as `C.29` mathematical-lens use or method-description representation, not as `U.MethodAlgebra`.

This branch recovers direct relations among already governed typed values. It publishes no new recovery object or super-kind; it keeps the project concern, actual relation participants, their direct relations, and the separately recovered FPF values from collapsing into one umbrella value.

A compact local restoration note records how wording restoration found those typed values: affected entity, bounded context, change or maintained-condition statement, state or delta predicates when current, and references to the governing method, description, mechanism, work, evidence, source-relation, gate, measurement, evaluation, choice, decision, publication, or temporal patterns. If a project needs a project record, evidence record, gate record, method, work plan, work occurrence, measurement-result episteme, evaluation result, `C.11` `ChoiceResult` or decision record, or ontic, use that direct governing pattern instead of treating the restoration note as the project value.

Each filled reference remains governed by its own pattern. `A.15` carries the role-method-plan-work alignment part; `A.3.1`, `A.3.2`, `A.6.0`, `C.29`, `A.6.1`, `E.20`, `A.10`, gate, source-relation, measurement, evaluation, decision, publication, temporal, and evidence patterns carry their own typed values. Do not assign one typed value as both `U.Method` and `U.Mechanism` unless a governing pattern explicitly admits that dual typing. Declaration-local SlotKind labels and relation-participant labels create no alternate ontology.

When `input`, `raw material`, epistemic `source data` or `source material`, `output`, `result`, `outcome`, `deliverable`, `handoff`, or work-name wording still hides one relation to method, plan, dated work, transformation, evaluation, delivery, transfer, or receiving use, apply `A.6.P.WMR` after generic relation recovery. Use `C.2.P` first for the epistemic source expression, episteme or publication, and source-to-use relation; keep physical raw material under its direct physical governor.

The WMR branch first recovers claim subject, modality and exact temporal extent, polarity, and recovery/support state independently, then closes with exactly one family: exact direct subject-relation claim, positive or governed negative; exact `A.6.1` operation-application binding; exact local `A.15.PROD` or `A.6.RCD` claim; or exact non-assertability result. Its reason is separately `factually unsupported`, `missing-information`, or `missing-governor`: the failed known `EpistemeUsedByReviewWorkAsReference` predicate uses the first; the unavailable ETL receiving-use fact under a known governor uses the second; and the absent `Patient_8472` / `HE-8472` health-effect relation kind and owner uses the third. Only `missing-governor` names the affected receiving use and future owner. Classification, a generic `result relation`, a `U.MethodDescription` field, a planned filling, an actual-slot-looking reference, or an inferred opposite polarity does not close the row.

If a current `U.*` name only duplicates a declaration-local SlotKind or relation-participant label, apply `E.24.UK` inside the E.24 ontic-introduction decision. Retain the `U.*` name only when a direct governing pattern supplies the durable-kind membership condition and the E.24 decision supplies stable ontic identity and action-facing gain. Otherwise keep the SlotKind declaration-local or keep the participant meaning as relation prose. If repeated method, work, and process material needs a durable ontic, write its E.24 decision and governing head pattern before citing it as current FPF ontology.

Use this recovery order for FPF-relevant wording-use restoration cases. Each realization pattern may publish a compact local form, but the order stays shared.

1. **Trigger and bounded text.** Name the bounded text span or publication unit, trigger span, local sentence function, register classification, and whether the text is conformant FPF, project text deliberately using FPF-governed terms, pattern references, relation names, or conformance claims, or source text being unpacked for possible FPF use.
2. **Cheap local closure.** Check whether the wording has no FPF-governed use or only a small local head, register, or morphology repair. If yes, repair locally under `E.10`, state the remaining reader use, and stop.
3. **Head kind and candidate ontology.** Recover the head kind, register classification, EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary, specification-use gate when current, candidate referents, candidate EntityOfConcern values, direct relation kinds and actual participants, reusable `RelationSignature` and `SlotSpec` declarations when current, claim-bearing epistemes and participant designations when current, candidate carriers or publications, and scope, time, viewpoint, or context facets. Include literal and intended candidates when metonymy or compression is plausible.
4. **Semantic area, ontological neighborhood, and governing-pattern selection.** State `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, `semanticArea`, and `semanticAreaSenseFamily`; then select the `ontologicalNeighborhood` and first applicable governing pattern by primary `EntityOfConcern` kind and admissible adjacent FPF fields. The alternatives in this sentence are governing-pattern neighborhoods, not one hidden kind: relation construction, function-like kind and relation recovery, episteme, publication, source relation, selected structure or architecture description, characteristic or scale construction, quality characterization, evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, causal-use, naming, controlled coarsening, or another governing FPF pattern.
5. **Formal apparatus or stable substrate.** State the stable apparatus that makes the repair checkable. The alternatives are governed apparatus families, not one object type: direct relation predicate and occurrence-identity rule; reusable `RelationSignature` SlotSpecs; publication relations; source-relation disposition; selected structure; architecture question; characteristic or scale construction; quality bundle; mathematical lens under `C.29`; evidence or provenance relation; work occurrence; decision, assurance, gate, or causal-use object under its direct pattern; or another governing-pattern field set. When the same entity participates in several direct relations, is designated by several assertion epistemes, or corresponds to several representation elements, keep those uses distinct and cite each governing pattern. `E.10.ARCH` selects the restoration architecture rather than duplicating those ontologies.
6. **Normalized ontology and lexical projection.** Produce repaired wording, a compact repair note, a claim-bearing episteme, a direct governing-pattern application, or a non-use disposition according to the recovered object. Do not replace one umbrella word with another. The replacement candidate is itself a bounded wording use until it passes the `E.10` trigger scan or is demoted to ordinary wording, quote-only wording, reduced-use cue, blocked use, or incomplete rewrite.
7. **Admissible use and remaining reader use.** State the admissible use, non-admissible claim escalation or adjacent use, and one useful reader use. If the wording is type-correct but inert, the repair is incomplete.

Perform a terminology-source audit only when source ontology can change the recovered governed object, direct relation kind, relation-participant meaning, actual participant kind, declaration-local SlotSpec, assertion-side participant designation, exact use, admissible use, or governing-pattern selection. For relation-shaped material, apply the relation-use recovery rule above and `A.6.5` only when reusable typed declaration is current. Do not turn stable ordinary prose into type annotation merely because the repair can name its ontology.

The sequence is shared; each wording-use restoration case differs by `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, `semanticArea`, `semanticAreaSenseFamily`, primary `EntityOfConcern` use fields, current governed object, any exact direct relation use, `ontologicalNeighborhood`, governing pattern, substrate, and result.

### E.10.ARCH:4 - Applicability table

| Semantic area and ontological neighborhood | First applicable pattern | Trigger family | Required recovery apparatus | Typical recovery product |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Relation construction; primary recoverable use is relation use or a relation-bearing claim | `A.6.P` and retained A.6 relation specializations; `A.6.RCD` only after exact participants are recovered and no current direct relation closes the named receiving claim | Relation, endpoint, qualifier, slot, scope, time, viewpoint, evidence-use relation distinction when evidence use is current, basedness, service, bridge wording, whole or part, mapping, comparison, dependency, or evaluative ascription when the hidden claim is relation construction. | Direct relation kind; actual participants and relation-participant meanings; obtaining predicate; occurrence identity only when a named receiving use needs it; or, for the exact residual, the `A.6.RCD` disposition. `RelationSignature` and SlotSpecs appear only for reusable typed declaration; assertion or description episteme and participant designations only when the claim is current. | readable existing direct relation statement, local compound claim, reusable predicate-definition episteme, separately settled derived or primitive relation kind, direct governing-pattern application, retained specialization application named by value, or fail-closed Plain disposition. |
| Relation-signature-interface-role-slot semantic area; primary recoverable use is hidden among relation, relation slot, signature, interface claim, role value, role assignment, role description, port, boundary claim bundle, neighboring candidate value, or reduced-use source label | `A.6.RSIR` when the direct governing pattern is not already clear; direct governing pattern when recovered by value | Relation, signature, interface, role, assignment, enactment, slot, field, parameter, argument, endpoint, port, API, protocol, connector, capability, affordance, method, function, concern, interest, role-holder grammar, or close source wording. | Project concern, current EntityOfConcern or claim kind, slot discipline under `A.6.5` when current, direct governing pattern selection, retained source-label use, blocked overread, and stop condition. Direct governing patterns include `A.6.P`, `A.6.5`, `A.6.0`, `A.2`, `A.2.1`, `A.15`, `A.6.M`, `A.6.F`, `A.6.A`, method, work, publication, evidence, status, gate, problem, and characteristic-space patterns named by value. | `RSIRRepairNote`, direct governing-pattern application, reduced-use source label, quote-only cue, blocked-use disposition, or stop. |
| Function-like wording; primary recoverable use is the FPF kind named by value, relation, or claim hidden by `function`, `functional`, `functionality`, `effect`, or similar wording | `A.6.F` first when the FPF kind named by value, relation, or claim is not already recovered; direct governing pattern when it is recovered by value | Functional architecture, required transformation or effect, method, work occurrence, direct subject effect, measurement-result episteme, evaluation result, `C.11` `ChoiceResult` or decision record, role expectation, mathematical function, relation, loss, objective, quality or functionality claim, module allocation, interface or signature relation, or evidence, assurance, gate, or decision overread. | `FunctionUseRepair`, kind and relation recovery, false-kind list, governing-pattern reference, `C.30` or `C.30.ASV` functional-structure boundary, `C.29` mathematical-lens boundary, `C.16` or `C.25` quality boundary, `A.6.M` module-interface relations and A.6 signature or slot applications. | FPF kind or relation named by value assignment, governing-pattern application, `FunctionFlowModuleAlignmentNote`, mathematical-lens application, quality or characteristic application, `A.6.M` module-interface application, ordinary-prose demotion, or stop. |

| Ontic candidate and publication-form confusion; primary recoverable use is a candidate subject for a durable ontic, its possible core direct relation, an ontic-description episteme, or a publication form hidden behind record, card, schema, table, data-structure, view, or source-material wording | `E.24.CD` for candidate detection; `E.24.PUB` for ontic-description and publication-form boundary; direct subject pattern when the ontic or governing pattern is already recovered | ontic, concept cluster, semantic area, ontological neighborhood, slot relation, slot-relation expression, schema, record, card, table, data structure, publication form, description, view, or source-material wording. | candidate subject, possible primary governed subject kind, stable identity, core direct relation, named neighboring direct relations, governing patterns, publication-form boundary, admissible use, blocked overread, and remaining reader use. | ontic-candidate note, direct `E.24` or subject-pattern application, `E.24.PUB` boundary note, ordinary-prose demotion, quote-only cue, reduced-use cue, blocked-use disposition, or stop. |
| Admissibility-like, legality-like, authority, validity, readiness, pass-looking, fail-looking, and conformance wording; primary recoverable use is bearer, claim kind, source relation, value frame, bounded use, and governing pattern, not a generic admissibility object | Direct governing pattern when the claim is recoverable by value; `A.19.SPR` only when a hidden state-family bearer and value frame are the problem; `A.6.P` only when relation construction is hidden | `admissible`, `lawful`, `legal`, `legality`, `allowed`, `permitted`, `authorized`, `valid`, `pass`, `fail`, `ready`, `conformant`, `eligible`, and close compounds. | bearer, claim kind, source relation, value frame, admissible use, non-admissible overread, validity window or reopen condition when current, and direct governing pattern for mechanism admissibility predicate, signature applicability, evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, authority-bearing record, release, temporal validity, or source-relation disposition. | direct governing-pattern application; state-family repair note only when hidden state wording is current; recovered gate, evidence, authority, temporal, mechanism, or source-relation boundary; quote-only cue; reduced-use cue; blocked-use disposition; or stop. |
| Method, algorithm, program, solver, proof, recipe, workflow, process, procedure, access path, query plan, control strategy, method algebra, method graph, selector calculus, or programming-paradigm wording; primary recoverable use is a current method, work, mechanism, or description object, exact direct relation use, claim kind, or method relation structure | `A.3.1` first when method-like wording hides that governed object, direct relation use, claim kind, or method relation structure; direct governing pattern after recovery; `C.2.P.DR` first when representation overread is the current problem | algorithm, program, solver, proof, recipe, method, workflow, process, procedure, access path, query plan, control strategy, imperative, functional, logical, constraint, object-centric event, effect-handler, pipeline, orchestration, method algebra, method graph, selector calculus, fallback composition, or similar wording. | Context-local semantic way of doing under `A.3.1`; `MethodRelationStructure@BoundedContext` when composition, refinement, substitution, iteration, guarded choice, decomposition, parameterization, method-family membership, selector relation, or fallback relation is current; episteme describing a method or method relation structure under `A.3.2`; formal-substrate declaration under `A.6.0`; mathematical-lens use under `C.29`; mechanism declaration or realization under `A.6.1` and `E.20`; planned work under `A.15.2`; dated work under `A.15.1`; selector outcome under `G.5`; exact evidence, source, gate, measurement, evaluation, decision, or other direct relation use; `A.6.P.WMR` when a boundary relation involving a Work occurrence is still hidden; direct governing pattern; or quote-only source wording. If one source label points to changing, producing, selecting, deriving, controlling, or maintaining an `EntityOfConcern` rather than one typed value, use the method, work, and P2W constellation in section 3.1 and recover each linked value and direct relation separately. Declaration-local SlotKind labels and relation-participant labels create no alternate ontology. | `U.Method` statement, `MethodRelationStructure@BoundedContext` statement, `U.MethodDescription` relation, formal-substrate or mathematical-lens application, `U.Mechanism` or MIP application, WorkPlan or Work application, G.5 selector application, exact evidence, source, gate, measurement, evaluation, or decision relation use, one `A.6.P.WMR` exit when that branch is current, direct governing-pattern application, quote-only cue, reduced-use cue, blocked-use disposition, or stop. |
| Work/method-boundary relation recovery and performed-work naming basis | `A.6.P.WMR` after generic `A.6.P` recovery; `C.2.P` first for epistemic source data or source material; direct subject pattern when already recoverable; `F.18` only after the governed value is known | Input, raw material, source data, source material, output, result, outcome, deliverable, handoff, or action-nominal wording whose exact claim about a relation involving a Work occurrence or occurrence basis is hidden | Exact entity; related method, plan, dated work, transformation, evaluation, delivery, transfer, or receiving use; four orthogonal dimensions: claim subject, modality and exact temporal extent, polarity, and recovery/support state; and either an exact direct relation or the exact reason-specific non-assertability basis. A performed-work name additionally requires its `A.15.1` occurrence basis, and neighboring governed results remain separate. | Exactly one WMR exit family: short positive or governed-negative direct subject-relation sentence; exact `A.6.1` application binding; exact local `A.15.PROD`/`A.6.RCD` claim; or exact non-assertability result independently reasoned as `factually unsupported`, `missing-information`, or `missing-governor`. Only the last names a future owner. An occurrence-grounded `F.18` naming result may follow the governed value but is not a fifth WMR exit. No universal input, output, result, outcome, handoff, production, or actual-filling ontology. |
| Declarative representation and imperative-metaphor overread; primary recoverable use is a representation, relation, predicate, graph object, publication face, evidence relation, or pattern relation being treated as action, route, call, dispatch, permission, release, work, or evidence result | `C.2.P.DR` when no direct governing pattern already closes the claim; direct governing pattern when recovered by value | graph path, `PathSlice`, flow valuation, state predicate, checklist predicate, SQL-like query, table, dashboard, publication face, evidence-path wording, pattern relation, representation, route, path, workflow, lifecycle, dispatch, exit, receiver, call, invoke, run, flow, send, move, or `EvidencePath` wording. | encountered representation, representation kind, represented object or claim, source-expression or publication relation when current, tempting imperative overread, recovered governing pattern, admissible use now, non-admissible overread, stop or reopen trigger, and graph, evidence, publication, method, work, gate, or authority pattern named by value when current. | `DeclarativeRepresentationRepair`, graph or path application under `E.18`, evidence or provenance relation under `A.10`, state-family repair under `A.19.SPR`, publication-face use under `E.17`, mathematical-lens use under `C.29`, method, method-description, work, gate, or authority direct application, quote-only cue, reduced-use cue, blocked-use disposition, or stop. |

| Stratification and source labels; primary recoverable use is hidden behind `layer`, `level`, `tier`, `stack`, `ladder`, `rung`, `block`, `expert`, `cache`, `router`, `gate`, or close engineering source labels | `C.30.STRAT` when the governing pattern is not already recovered; direct governing pattern when it is recovered by value | Engineering, mathematical, publication, project, control, module, neural-network, or architecture prose uses a source label as if it named the FPF kind directly. | The required recovery apparatus is a row of fields for one source-label repair: source label, literal source wording, candidate primary EntityOfConcern, recovered FPF kind, recovered relation, recovered claim-use, recovered source-relation disposition, governing-pattern selection, admissible use, non-use boundary, and adjacent governing-pattern applications to `C.30.P`, `C.30.LCA`, `A.6.M`, current Architecture Transformation-Flow Structure Relation (`C.30.TFS-REL`), `E.18`, `C.16.P`, `C.29`, `C.2.P`, gate, work, or decision patterns, or ordinary source label. | `StratificationSourceLabelRepairNote`, direct governing-pattern application, ordinary-prose demotion, quote-only, reduced-use, or blocked-use disposition, or stop. |
| Characteristic and scale; primary recoverable use is characteristic, scale, coordinate, score, comparison, indicator role, or characteristic-space construction | `C.16.P` | Characteristic, scale, coordinate, value, score, indicator, threshold, comparison, metric, axis, dimension, feature, property, level, strong, weak, robust, or benchmark wording whose construction is not yet recoverable. | `A.17` Characteristic, `A.18` CSLC, `C.16` measurement, unit, evidence stub, `A.19` `CharacteristicSpace`, `C.25` Q-bundle, `C.29` mathematical-lens boundary, and `E.21` pattern-quality coordinate discipline. | characteristic-scale repair note, declared `Characteristic`, `Scale`, `Coordinate`, `Value`, and `Score` construction, non-comparability, non-measurement, blocked-gate disposition, governing-pattern result, ordinary-prose demotion, or stop. |
| Quality characterization and evaluative characterization; primary recoverable use is quality characterization, Q-bundle use, or pattern-quality coordinate use | `C.16.Q` | Quality or evaluative characterization wording when the hidden claim is not relation construction. | `C.16.P` where bearer or scale construction is hidden, `C.25` Q-bundle, `E.21` pattern-quality coordinates, and characterization or relation applications named by value. | quality-term repair note, quality-bundle or pattern-quality coordinate use, relation or bridge split when current, blocked scalar, gate, or release overread, governing-pattern result, ordinary-prose demotion, or stop. |
| State-family hidden claim; primary recoverable use is a bearer with a state-like value, status, readiness, currentness, or local finite field whose frame is hidden | `A.19.SPR` | State, status, posture, readiness, stance, currentness, validity, stable, accepted, blocked, candidate, admissible, ready, degraded, or close state-family compounds. | bearer kind, state frame or governing pattern, value set or classification source, admissible use, non-admissible overread, validity window or reopen condition, and direct governing-pattern application for source, evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, temporal, lens-use, pattern-quality, or process cases. | state-family repair note, retained local field with bearer, value set, and admissible use named by value, direct governing-pattern application, quote-only cue, reduced-use cue, blocked use, ordinary-prose demotion, or stop. |
| Neighboring claim or admissible-use boundary already recoverable by value | Evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, causal-use, release, mathematical-lens, naming, controlled-coarsening, action-invitation, `A.6.M` module-interface, or another governing-pattern application | Any trigger family whose recovered FPF kind, relation, claim-use, source-relation disposition, or admissible-use boundary is already recoverable by value. | The governing pattern's own ontology and conformance fields. | Direct governing-pattern application; no detour through a new restoration pattern. |

**Architecture source-word recovery note.** When architecture prose says that a source, document, view, ADR, diagram, dashboard, model, publication face, or source-return condition carries an architecture claim, do not mint an architecture-local `Source` kind. Use `C.2.P` first only while source expression, publication construction, carrier-relation construction, source relation, project-side reference, or non-use disposition is still hidden. After recovery, the governing pattern is selected declaratively: `C.30.P` for architecture or structure wording, `C.30.AD` for architecture-description and source-return use, `C.30.ASV` for structural-view adequacy, `C.32` for architecture synthesis or decision claims, or the governing pattern for direct evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, publication, or currentness when that is the actual claim.

### E.10.ARCH:5 - Direct known governing-pattern rule

If the governing pattern and current governed object, exact direct relation use, claim-bearing episteme, representation use, or claim kind are already recoverable by value, use that governing pattern directly. Do not put direct `C.30`, `C.16`, `C.29`, `E.21`, `E.18`, `A.10`, `A.3.1`, `A.3.2`, `A.6.0`, `A.6.1`, `E.20`, `A.15.PROD`, evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, causal-use, release, naming, controlled-coarsening, action-invitation, `A.6.M` module-interface, publication-face, or mathematical-lens cases through a restoration pattern only because a familiar trigger word appears. `A.6.P.WMR` is used only while the exact work/method-boundary relation or exact non-assertability result remains hidden. Its known-predicate failure, unavailable-fact, and absent-governor reasons stay separately `factually unsupported`, `missing-information`, and `missing-governor`; only the last is a blocker that names a future owner.

Apply `A.6.RSIR`, `A.6.P`, `A.6.P.WMR`, `A.6.F`, `C.2.P`, `C.2.P.DR`, `C.30.P`, `C.30.STRAT`, `C.16.P`, `C.16.Q`, `A.19.SPR`, or `A.3.1` only when wording hides the EntityOfConcern under repair, direct relation use, role assignment, signature declaration, interface claim, declaration-local SlotKind, characteristic, scale, score, quality characterization, comparison reference set, source-relation disposition, state-family value, method-side governed object, work/method-boundary claim, declarative-representation use, admissible use, or remaining reader use.

### E.10.ARCH:6 - Admission and extraction criterion

Add or retain a `WordingUseRestorationApplicabilityRow` when all of the following are true:

- the wording recurs across FPF-governed texts or project text deliberately using FPF-governed terms, pattern references, relation names, or conformance claims;
- the hidden primary-EntityOfConcern use field set is stable;
- the recovery apparatus or field set is stable enough to teach;
- repeated in-place repair distracts from the subject pattern's primary EntityOfConcern and first useful move;
- a useful remaining reader use survives after overread removal;
- no existing governing pattern already carries the row without duplicating repair-only doctrine inside subject patterns.

Do not add a new realization pattern when an existing governing pattern such as `A.6.F`, `A.6.A`, `A.6.M`, `A.15.4`, `A.6.6`, `A.6.3.CSC`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `A.15`, `C.11`, `C.28`, or another governing pattern already carries the EntityOfConcern under repair, relation, claim, or field. Record that pattern as the `governingPattern`.

Extract repair-only material from a subject pattern when the material is only wording-recognition lists, false-friend rows, anti-umbrella prose, or repair fields that must run before the subject pattern can state its own invariant. Leave a narrow first-use cue or governing-pattern relation in the subject pattern.

Keep material in the subject pattern when it states the subject pattern's own invariant, worked case, conformance condition, characteristic construction, structural construction, mathematical lens, source-return condition, or user action.

### E.10.ARCH:7 - Subject-pattern thin-pointer rule

Subject patterns keep at most one local first-use cue when the EntityOfConcern under repair, relation, claim, or field is hidden, then name the selected precision-restoration pattern as a pattern through ordinary references or `Relations`. They do not turn that reference into local reference boilerplate, and they do not copy:

- the full `E.10` wording-recognition table;
- this shared algorithm;
- the `WordingUseRestorationApplicabilityTable`;
- broad false-friend lists whose only job is first-stage repair;
- past placement or repair history written in place of current architecture prose.

A thin pointer is acceptable when it helps the working reader choose the right first move, for example:

- use `C.30.P` when architecture or structure wording hides whether the use under repair is selected structure, architecture-description use, structural-view use, source, model, diagram, graph, dashboard, or ordinary prose;
- use `C.30.STRAT` when `layer`, `level`, `tier`, `stack`, `ladder`, `rung`, `block`, `expert`, `cache`, `router`, `gate`, or a close source label hides whether the use under repair is a control-layer relation, module-interface relation, architecture-to-`TransformationFlowStructure` relation, scale or coarse-graining relation, publication relation set, gate relation, neighboring use named by value, ordinary source label, quote-only cue, or blocked use;
- use `C.16.P` when metric, score, axis, dimension, feature, property, indicator, strong, weak, robust, level, coordinate, threshold, or comparison wording hides characteristic or scale construction;
- use `C.16.Q` when quality or evaluative characterization wording hides Q-bundle, pattern-quality coordinate, relation construction, action-invitation, bridge, or characterization use named by value;
- use `A.19.SPR` when state, status, posture, readiness, stance, currentness, or a local state-like field hides bearer, state frame, value set, admissible use, or governing pattern;
- use `C.2.P` when source, publication, publication form, face, `PublicationUnit`, dashboard, documentation, or text-work wording hides source-currentness relation or project-side reliance;
- use `A.3.1` when method, algorithm, program, proof, solver, workflow, process, procedure, access-path, query-plan, control-strategy, method-algebra, method-graph, selector-calculus, or programming-paradigm wording hides whether the current slot is method, method relation structure, method description, formal substrate, mathematical-lens use, mechanism, work plan, dated work, evidence relation, or quote-only source wording;
- use `A.6.RSIR` when relation, signature, interface, role, assignment, enactment, slot, field, parameter, argument, endpoint, port, API, protocol, connector, capability, affordance, method, function, concern, or interest wording hides the current governed object or claim kind and no direct governing pattern is yet clear;

- use `A.6.P.WMR` when input, raw-material, source-data, source-material, output, result, outcome, deliverable, handoff, or work-name wording hides one exact work/method-boundary relation-bearing claim; use `C.2.P` first for the epistemic source side, and return one of the four truthful WMR exits rather than classification or actual-slot fallback;
- use `C.2.P.DR` when a declarative representation, graph relation, evidence-path wording, publication face, checklist predicate, query, dashboard, or pattern relation is being overread as an imperative route, call, dispatch, work sequence, permission, release, evidence result, or pattern application;
- use the direct governing pattern, with `A.19.SPR` only when hidden state-family wording remains, when admissibility-like, legal, lawful, validity, pass-looking, fail-looking, readiness, conformance, or authority wording already recovers its bearer, claim kind, source relation, value frame, and admissible use.

### E.10.ARCH:8 - Name and placement discipline

`semanticArea` is the selected Part-F Tech term for the semantic unit used by a wording-use restoration row. Plain speech may say "semantic area" or "meaning area" only as a gloss for that declared Part-F row or bounded row-set.

`meaning area`, `theme`, `pattern area`, `pattern cluster`, `workstream`, `campaign`, `module`, and `branch` are not selected as Tech architecture terms for this distribution. Tech prose must resolve those cues into `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, `semanticArea`, `semanticAreaSenseFamily`, `entityOfConcernUseFields`, `ontologicalNeighborhood`, `governingPattern` named by value, and realization pattern.

`pattern nest` is allowed for ID and placement grouping such as `A.6.*`, `C.16.*`, or `C.30.*`. It is not a semantic parent relation and not an authority relation.

`SelectedLocusObligationClosure` is the current `E.9.DA` coordinate name for selected-locus obligation closure. Do not reintroduce `ReceivingLocusObligationClosure` as a general obligation kind, locus kind, pattern role, or restoration vocabulary.

### E.10.ARCH:9 - Examples and near misses

| Wording | Applicable result | Blocked overread |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "The architecture is the diagram." | `C.30.P` recovers whether the diagram is publication form, structure view, architecture description, source relation, or ordinary source-finding cue; then `C.30` or `C.30.ASV` applies only after the selected architecture or structural-view use is recovered. | diagram-as-architecture; diagram-as-proof; diagram-as-gate. |
| "`ArchitectureOf@PlantOps` is defined over structures S1 and S2 under context C." | Direct `C.30`; no `C.30.P` unless selected structure, architecture-description use, structural-view use, source relation, model relation, diagram relation, graph relation, dashboard relation, or ordinary prose remains hidden. | unnecessary restoration detour. |
| "The model has three layers." | `C.30.STRAT` treats `layers` as a source label until the recovered FPF kind, relation, claim-use, or source-relation disposition is recovered: control-layer relation, neural-network block sequence, publication relation set, mathematical scale or coarse-graining relation, or ordinary source wording. Then the governing pattern applies to the recovered result. | layer-as-universal-kind; source label as proof of structure. |
| "The query plan calls the next pattern." | `C.2.P.DR` recovers whether the query plan is a representation, method description, formal substrate, evidence or provenance relation, or ordinary source wording; if a pattern relation is current, the relation is stated declaratively rather than as a call. | query-as-work sequence; pattern relation as invocation. |
| "The evidence path authorizes release." | If a provenance relation for a claim is current, use `A.10`; if authorization or release is current, use the authority, gate, or release pattern. `C.2.P.DR` applies only when `path` wording turns the relation into an action route or permission. | evidence path as permission; graph relation as release. |
| "The solver algorithm is the mechanism." | `A.3.1` first recovers whether the current slot is method, method description, formal substrate, mathematical-lens use, mechanism declaration or realization, work, evidence, or quote-only wording. Use `A.6.1` and `E.20` only when operation algebra, admissibility rules, transport, audit, or governing-definition assignment is current. | algorithm-as-default-method; method-as-mechanism by vocabulary. |
| "This record is admissible." | Recover bearer, claim kind, source relation, value frame, admissible use, and governing pattern. Use `A.19.SPR` only if hidden state-family wording remains; otherwise use the direct evidence, gate, mechanism, temporal, authority, release, or source-relation pattern. | admissible-as-generic status; pass-looking word as gate. |
| "This score proves readiness." | `C.16.P` recovers characteristic, scale, value, score, threshold, comparison reference set, and gate, evidence, and decision pattern applications. | score-as-proof; score-as-release permission. |
| "This source supports the claim." | `C.2.P` is used if source-currentness relation or publication relation set is current; relation slice applies `A.6.P`; final use states recovered relation or non-use disposition. | source-as-proof; support-as-generic relation. |
| "Quality improved." | `C.16.Q` recovers quality characterization or evaluative characterization, or names the `C.16.P`, `C.25`, `E.21`, `A.6.P`, action, work, or bridge pattern application governing the recovered claim. | quality-as-one scalar; quality-as-gate. |
| "The function improved maintainability." | `A.6.F` first recovers the FPF kind named by value, relation, or claim when hidden; quality or maintainability wording is then governed by `C.16.P`, `C.16.Q`, `C.25`, or the quality pattern governing the current claim. | function-as-default-architecture; maintainability-as-unscaled verdict. |
| "Read this pattern for improvement proposals." | Recover whether the current FPF-governed use is source-publication use, bounded comparative review unit, or improvement-oriented evaluation.

### E.10.ARCH:9.1 - Archetypal Grounding

| Situation | E.10.ARCH move | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture text repeatedly says diagrams, ADRs, dashboards, and views are not architecture. | Use the architecture and structure row, then apply `C.30.P` or `C.30.AD` according to the recovered architecture field. | C.30 remains about architecture and selected structures, not a generic diagram-warning pattern. |
| Method text uses algorithm, workflow, solver, proof, and program as one family. | Use the method, work, and P2W constellation row and recover method, method description, formal substrate, mechanism, work plan, dated work, or evidence relation separately. | Do not assign one typed value to several kinds because one source label was shared. |
| A dashboard or evidence-path wording is treated as permission or release. | Use the declarative-representation row or the direct evidence, gate, authority, or release pattern. | Graph and provenance relations remain legitimate when they are not overread as routes, calls, permissions, or releases. |

### E.10.ARCH:9.2 - Bias-Annotation

This pattern blocks semio-bias in two directions. It prevents subject patterns from becoming patterns about descriptions, records, and wording guards. It also prevents word-replacement bias by requiring recovery of the ontological neighborhood, direct governing pattern, and admissible reader use before a new term is selected.

### E.10.ARCH:10 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Observable conformance condition |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-E10ARCH-1` | `E.10` remains the compact trigger-and-applicability pattern; `E.10.ARCH` carries the shared algorithm and applicability-row architecture. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-2` | Each `WordingUseRestorationApplicabilityRow` names `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, `semanticArea`, `semanticAreaSenseFamily`, primary EntityOfConcern kind and use fields, `ontologicalNeighborhood`, first applicable restoration or governing pattern, recovery product, non-use boundary, and remaining reader use. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-3` | Direct known governing-pattern cases use the governing pattern directly instead of creating a restoration detour. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-4` | A new realization pattern is added only when no existing governing pattern carries the stable recovery shape without duplicating repair-only doctrine inside subject patterns. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-5` | Subject patterns of concern keep their primary `EntityOfConcern` and first useful move central and carry only thin first-use cues to precision restoration when wording is hidden. Generic guards about description and publication use are kept in a named description and publication-use boundary section or description-publication pattern governing that use; they do not become the subject Solution. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6` | `reading`, `read`, and `quality-read` wording remains trigger wording and does not mint `ReadingPrecisionRestoration`. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6a` | EntityOfConcern-like hidden fields follow the selected distribution: `E.10` recognizes the wording-use row, `C.2.1` carries slot and reference ontology, `C.2.P` restores episteme, publication, source-wording, and source-relation wording, `F.18` settles durable heads and source-string decisions, `E.17.AUD.OOTD` carries publication-unit primary entity of concern, and governing patterns carry their own claim being made or admissible-use boundary. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6b` | State-family wording follows the selected distribution: `E.10` recognizes the wording-use row, `A.19.SPR` realizes recurring hidden bearer, state-frame, value, and use recovery, and governing patterns carry already-recovered evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, temporal, mathematical-lens, pattern-quality, source-relation, or process cases directly. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6c` | Stratification and source-label wording follows the selected distribution: `E.10` recognizes the wording-use row, `C.30.STRAT` realizes recurring source-label repair, and governing patterns carry already-recovered control-layer, module-interface, architecture-to-`TransformationFlowStructure`, scale or coarse-graining, publication relation set, gate, work, decision, or ordinary non-use cases directly. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6d` | Admissibility-like, legal, lawful, validity, pass-looking, fail-looking, readiness, conformance, and authority wording does not mint a generic admissibility object. The repair recovers bearer, claim kind, source relation, value frame, admissible use, non-admissible overread, and the direct governing pattern; `A.19.SPR` is used only when hidden state-family wording remains. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6e` | Method-like and algorithm-like wording first recovers the project concern, then separately governed method, description, mechanism, work, representation, and direct relation uses through the existing method, work, and P2W governing-pattern constellation. One source label may link several typed values, but no typed value is both `U.Method` and `U.Mechanism` unless a governing pattern explicitly admits dual typing. Declaration-local SlotKind labels and relation-participant labels create no alternate ontology. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6f` | Declarative representation overread follows `C.2.P.DR` unless a direct graph, evidence, publication, method, work, gate, authority, or pattern-relation pattern already governs the recovered claim by value. Graph paths remain legitimate graph relations when that is the current claim; evidence-path wording is legitimate only after recovery as an evidence or provenance relation. They become repair triggers when read as routes, calls, dispatches, permissions, releases, work sequences, or evidence results by metaphor. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6g` | Terminology-source audit is bounded: source-ontology labels are recovered when they affect the governed object, direct relation kind, relation-participant meaning, actual participant kind, declaration-local SlotSpec, assertion-side participant designation, exact use, admissible use, or governing-pattern selection; otherwise stable ordinary prose stays ordinary. Relation-shaped material follows the relation-use recovery rule, and `interface` is used only under a governing boundary, module-interface, signature, port, publication, or source-label disposition. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6h` | Relation-signature-interface-role-slot wording follows the selected two-level architecture: `E.10` recognizes the trigger row, `E.10.ARCH` places the row, `A.6.RSIR` recovers project concern and current EntityOfConcern or claim kind only until a direct governing pattern is clear, and the direct pattern owns the final repair. Do not mint generic `U.Interface`, a standalone role-slot ontic, `U.Concern`, `U.Interest`, or episteme-role ontology. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6i` | Work/method-boundary wording follows the selected row: `E.10` recognizes the full trigger family, `C.2.P` closes any epistemic source side first, and `A.6.P.WMR` returns exactly one family: one exact direct subject-relation claim, positive or governed negative; one exact `A.6.1` application binding; one local `A.15.PROD` claim or another local relation-bearing claim selected under `A.6.RCD` disposition 2; or one exact non-assertability result independently reasoned as `factually unsupported`, `missing-information`, or `missing-governor`. Only `missing-governor` names the affected receiving use and future owner. `F.18` names performed work only after occurrence grounding. Classification, a generic result relation, or method-description/actual-slot fallback is non-conformant. |

| `CC-E10ARCH-7` | `function`, `functional`, `functionality`, and `effect` wording keeps `A.6.F` as first unpacker when the governed FPF object, direct relation use, claim-bearing episteme, view, or governing-pattern application is hidden and does not default to architecture. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-8` | `semanticArea`, `ontologicalNeighborhood`, and `pattern nest` follow `E.8` placement discipline: `semanticArea` is the Part-F semantic unit, `ontologicalNeighborhood` is its applicability neighborhood, and `pattern nest` is placement. None of them becomes workstream, campaign, module, or authority-bearing record. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-9` | Repair removes overread and preserves one useful admissible reader use. Type-correct but inert wording is not recovered by value. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-10` | Validation checks cover duplicate wording-recognition tables, stale quality-term-restoration links, broad `U.*` heads, shadow restoration apparatus, and entry or index drift. |

### E.10.ARCH:11 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Classification or actual-slot fallback without repair | The text says "this belongs under `A.6.P`/`C.2.P`/`A.6.P.WMR`", calls the answer a generic result relation, or treats a method-description field, planned filling, compatible type, or actual-slot-looking reference as the participant relation, but leaves no recovered wording, governed object, direct relation use, claim-bearing episteme, source-relation disposition, truthful WMR exit, direct governing-pattern application, or blocker. | Apply the selected pattern to one truthful repair result or fail closed; do not infer actuality from description or slot appearance. |
| Trigger registry copying | `E.19`, `C.30.P`, `C.16.P`, `C.16.Q`, or a subject pattern copies the full `E.10` trigger list. | Keep one thin cue in the subject pattern of concern and cite `E.10` and `E.10.ARCH` through ordinary references or `Relations`. |
| Umbrella-to-umbrella replacement | `support` becomes `basis`, `display` becomes `view`, `reading` becomes `evaluation`, or `function` becomes `role` without a recovered governed object and exact use. | Recover the governed object, any direct relation use, admissible use, and remaining reader use; otherwise demote or block. |
| Source-ontology smuggling | `interface`, `schema`, `record`, `profile`, `path`, or another familiar source-domain word is used because it sounds precise, but the recovered governed object or direct relation use is different. | Recover the source ontology, governed object, exact direct relation use, any declaration-local SlotSpec or assertion-side designation, and governing pattern; keep the source word only when that pattern makes the meaning current. |
| Over-annotated restoration | A clear subject sentence is expanded into type labels or source-ontology commentary even though no object, kind, relation, slot, admissible use, or governing pattern changes. | Keep the ordinary wording; annotate only the claim-governing term under repair and use `F.19` if phrase apparatus remains. |
| Sterile precision | The wording is ontologically well-formed but no working reader can tell why the distinction matters or what reader use remains. | Restore the didactic or recognition function in admissible wording, or classify as reduced-use cue, quote-only, blocked use, or incomplete rewrite. |
| Shadow precision-restoration pattern | A subject pattern contains its own first-stage repair algorithm beside this distribution. | Extract repair-only material to the applicable realization pattern and leave a first-use cue. |
| Reference boilerplate in subject pattern | A subject pattern explains where the repair belongs, why the package was split, or what this text does not contain instead of stating the subject pattern's own repaired wording or first move. | Move architecture-placement rationale to `DRR` or architecture notes; replace routing prose with a normal pattern id, citation, or `Relations` row. |
| Apparatus-preserving paraphrase | A repair changes wording but keeps phrase-level apparatus around a recoverable kind. | Apply `F.19` first; return to `E.10.ARCH` only for remaining word, head, or use precision. |
| History placement as pattern prose | Past placement or old naming text explains history instead of current use. | Keep only current entry or repair rows where needed; write current pattern prose in the selected placement. |

### E.10.ARCH:9.3 - Consequences

**Benefits.** Wording-use restoration stays distributed but coherent; subject patterns stay object-centered; recurring hidden-field families get one recovery architecture instead of many local catalogues.

**Costs.** Authors must decide whether the current case is local `E.10`, a direct governing pattern, an existing restoration row, or a new row with a stable recovery shape.

**Risks avoided.** The main avoided risks are semio-bias in subject patterns, lexical substitution without kind recovery, and pattern-nest or placement language masquerading as semantic-area architecture.

### E.10.ARCH:2a - Rationale

This distribution is selected because the recurring failure is not "too few word rules". The failure is that repair-only trigger prose migrates into subject patterns and begins to compete with their primary `EntityOfConcern` and first useful moves. A common symptom is a non-semio pattern whose Solution mainly teaches that a description, view, publication, record, card, diagram, source, or file is not a permission, promise, prescription, evidence record, assurance verdict, decision, gate passage, release, work occurrence, or authority source. Those guards are often correct, but their ontology is publication pragmatics, description pragmatics, and neighboring-pattern assignment, not the subject matter of the architecture, method, role, evidence, or characterization pattern. A workable FPF answer therefore needs three separations at once: a cheap shared trigger scan in `E.10`, a shared recovery architecture in `E.10.ARCH`, and local realization only where a named `semanticArea` has stable row identity, a stable field set, an `ontologicalNeighborhood`, and a remaining reader use.


### E.10.ARCH:2a.1 - SoTA-Echoing

| Source or practice line | Source-use function or relation | What the line changes in `E.10.ARCH` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current FPF distribution: `E.10`, `E.10.ARCH`, `A.6.P`, `A.6.F`, `C.2.P`, `C.30.P`, `C.30.STRAT`, `C.16.P`, `C.16.Q`, `A.19.SPR`, `F.18`, `E.8`, `E.19`, `E.11`, and `I.2`. | Current FPF-internal architecture source line for the selected distribution. | Keeps `E.10` compact, puts the shared recovery algorithm in `E.10.ARCH`, assigns relation, source-relation, architecture, stratification-source-label, characteristic, quality, state-family, function-like, naming, entry-distribution, and expanded entry-disambiguation cases to realization or governing patterns named by value, and gives `E.19` a distribution-preservation check. |
| Pattern-language locality and FPF primary-EntityOfConcern discipline in `E.8` and `E.19`. | Current FPF authoring and review source line; not an external standard imported as ontology. | Forces thin governing-pattern pointers and blocks local wording-recognition-table copies inside patterns of concern whose real work is architecture, structure, characteristic, quality, evidence, gate, work, decision, state-family precision, or release. |
| Terminology and controlled-vocabulary practice named in `E.10:11a` only where it concerns designations, labels, discoverability, and controlled vocabulary publication. | Current-standard and reference-use source line; it does not define FPF kind ontology. | Provides explicit recovered heads and reusable-name discipline, but rejects a central word list or controlled vocabulary as the solution to every wording-use repair. |
| Current governing-pattern coverage in FPF. | Applicability boundary for this architecture, not evidence that E.10.ARCH owns every wording-use case. | Uses the direct governing pattern when that pattern can carry the EntityOfConcern under repair, relation, claim, or local field directly; reopens E.10.ARCH only when the shared distribution rule itself no longer fits. |

The selected architecture is lowered or reopened when one of those source lines changes: if `E.10` can close the issue locally, if a new governing pattern removes the need for a restoration row, if a realization pattern needs a different stable field set, or if subject patterns again start carrying duplicated first-stage trigger registries.

### E.10.ARCH:12 - Relations

- `E.10` recognizes and closes local wording issues or selects the applicable row.
- `A.6.RSIR` realizes first-level recovery for the relation, signature, interface, role, and slot cluster only until the direct governing pattern is clear.
- `A.6.P` realizes the shared algorithm for generic relation construction and retained relation specializations; `A.6.P.WMR` specializes one current method/work-boundary relation-bearing claim and returns exactly one family: an exact direct subject-relation claim, positive or governed negative; an exact `A.6.1` operation-application binding; a local `A.15.PROD` claim or another local relation-bearing claim selected under `A.6.RCD` disposition 2; or an exact non-assertability result independently reasoned as `factually unsupported`, `missing-information`, or `missing-governor`; only the last names the affected receiving use and future owner. `A.6.RCD` owns only the residual needed-claim derivation and relation-kind admission question after exact participants are known and no lighter current governor closes the receiver.

- `A.6.F` realizes function-like kind and relation recovery.
- `C.2.P` realizes source-expression, episteme, publication, and FPF-governed-use recovery.
- `C.2.P.DR` realizes declarative representation and imperative-metaphor overread repair.
- `A.3.1` governs `U.Method` and method-like slot recovery when semantic way of doing is hidden.
- `A.3.2` governs `U.MethodDescription` when an episteme describes a method.
- `A.6.0`, `C.29`, `A.6.1`, and `E.20` govern formal-substrate declarations, mathematical-lens use, mechanism meaning, and mechanism-governing-definition assignment when those claims are current.
- `A.15.2`, `A.15.1`, and `A.10` govern planned work, dated work, and evidence or provenance relations that method-like or path-like wording may otherwise hide; `A.15.PROD` governs the local production-work, entity-identity-inception, or production-completion claim when that exact WMR exit is current.
- `E.18` governs graph paths, path slices, flow valuations, and graph relations over selected `TransformationFlowStructure` when the graph claim is current.
- `C.30.P` realizes architecture and structure wording recovery.
- `C.30.STRAT` realizes stratification and source-label wording recovery for `layer`, `level`, `tier`, `stack`, `ladder`, `rung`, `block`, `expert`, `cache`, `router`, `gate`, and close source labels before return to the governing pattern.
- `C.16.P` realizes characteristic and scale wording recovery.
- `C.16.Q` realizes quality characterization and evaluative characterization wording recovery.
- `A.19.SPR` realizes state-family wording recovery when bearer, state frame, value set, admissible use, or governing pattern is hidden.
- `F.18` governs durable reusable naming after the kind under repair or relation is known.
- `F.19` governs phrase-level ontology-first plain technical rewriting after the kind under repair is recovered or while proving it is still hidden.
- `E.8` governs pattern-form and placement wording.
- `E.19` checks distribution preservation during review and refresh.
- `E.11` governs entry-distribution and assigns broad or old-term entry cases to README scenarios, ToC query cues, local Problem frames, or `I.2` expanded entry-disambiguation cases.
