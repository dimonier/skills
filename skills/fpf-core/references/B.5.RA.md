## B.5.RA - Recover an Argument for Its Next Use

> **Type:** Method pattern

### B.5.RA:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when you have an argument or a reported result but cannot yet understand why it supports the conclusion you want to use. Ordinary prose or dialogue may leave the argument itself uncertain: which claims are being made, which reasons work together and what the speaker is trying to establish. You may need to apply the result, criticize it, explain its decisive step or decide which part survives a proposed change.

The **argument** is the reasoning that connects premises to a conclusion. It may use a mathematical construction, a calculation or a subject inference from observations. The relevant practice supplies the permitted inference and the grounds for its premises.

**First useful move:** state what you want to do with the conclusion, then recover the main reason offered for it. Follow the needed intermediate claims until you can explain the decisive transition and its conditions.

The reader needs the subject preparation assumed by the source, or access to the missing explanation. Use an adequately understood result directly when its conditions already fit the task. A request to understand the argument can stop before re-proving every established result it uses. A separate obligation to validate the entire proof or underlying observations selects the corresponding checking work.

### B.5.RA:2 - Problem

An argument can be present without being usable by its reader. A reader may recognize each term yet miss why a lemma was introduced, where two premises must be used together, or how a local calculation establishes the general conclusion.

Reading each sentence fluently or checking isolated inferences leaves the overall method uncertain. Reading only the overview can hide a decisive unsupported transition. Either failure prevents useful transfer: the practitioner cannot tell what to use, which condition matters or where to ask for help.

The useful result is enough recovered reasoning to perform the intended use, or a localized gap whose resolution would make that use possible. This may be a conditional conclusion when a needed premise remains open.

### B.5.RA:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Local inference and overall method | Individual transitions can be understood while the purpose of a construction or the route to the conclusion remains obscure. |
| Understanding and checking | Understanding may reuse established results; validating a whole argument can require additional work under a different question. |
| Useful compression and hidden dependence | A lemma can make a long argument manageable, but the reader must know what it supplies and which conditions it uses. |
| Conditional result and unresolved premise | Useful consequences may follow before every premise is established, provided the next use preserves the condition. |
| Source recovery and new reasoning | Repairing a gap can open a valid use, while attribution must distinguish the supplied argument from the reader's addition. |

### B.5.RA:4 - Solution

Recover the reasoning at both the level of its main contributions and the transitions needed for the next use. Move between these levels when a local step changes your understanding of the whole argument.

#### B.5.RA:4.1 - State the use and read the claim

Name what the result would let you do: calculate a quantity, choose between alternatives, criticize a conclusion, adapt an argument or explain it to someone else. This determines how far recovery needs to go.

Read the conclusion with its objects, domain and conditions. In a mathematical statement, recover the quantifiers: which objects are arbitrary, which may be chosen, and on what a chosen object may depend. In an empirical argument, recover what observations and inference support which population, conditions or phenomenon.

Locate the source's definitions when a word or symbol admits different readings that would change this use. If a formal statement accompanies an informal one, compare the part of their meanings on which the intended application depends. For example, whether zero is allowed among “natural numbers” can change the statement.

#### B.5.RA:4.2 - Recover the main reason

Read for the difficulty the argument overcomes and the contribution that overcomes it. Ask why a construction, lemma, decomposition or comparison appears where it does.

Express the main reason in a short explanation: what is established first, what that makes possible, and how the remaining step reaches the conclusion. This may involve a reduction to an easier problem, an invariant, an exhaustive case distinction or another subject method. Use the method actually present in the source.

The first explanation is a working interpretation. Check it against the decisive steps. If it cannot explain why those steps are needed, revise it rather than retaining an attractive summary unrelated to the argument.

#### B.5.RA:4.3 - Recover the dependencies of the conclusion

Work backward from the conclusion through the claims or constructions it uses. At each needed transition, identify its premises, the inference or operation, and the result.

Keep jointly needed premises together. Preserve an independently sufficient alternative as a separate way to reach the conclusion. Track a shared premise wherever a later step uses it; repeated uses of one assumption do not provide independent support for that assumption.

Distinguish a premise supplied for the argument, a result established earlier and a temporary assumption used inside a subargument. Recover the point at which a temporary assumption is discharged and what then follows. If this logical form is unfamiliar, obtain the relevant explanation before treating the subargument's assumption as an established fact.

Use established results at the level needed for the task. If the question concerns what a lemma permits, its statement and conditions may suffice. If the question concerns how to alter the lemma's proof, recover its internal reasoning.

#### B.5.RA:4.4 - Explain the transition that is still missing

For a transition you cannot follow, recover the relevant definition, rule, earlier result or construction. Apply it to the participants at that transition. Say why these premises license this result and which condition is doing the work.

A useful self-explanation supplies this relation. “I understand this line” reports confidence; a paraphrase repeats the claim. Neither supplies the omitted inference when that is the difficulty.

Work a small instance when it helps reveal the operation or dependence. Then return to the stated scope: the instance may illustrate a general step, while the general conclusion still depends on the argument for all cases in its domain.

If the source's resources do not close the gap, ask for the missing step with its premises and desired result. A proposed repair is new reasoning until it is justified. Keep the consequence conditional when a premise remains unresolved and conditional use is sufficient.

Where the missing step constructs an auxiliary object, use B.5.RC. Where it makes a statistical, causal or other subject inference, use that subject's method and conditions.

#### B.5.RA:4.4a - Construct and examine an argument from prose or dialogue

Use this branch to examine testimony, analogy or a practical recommendation whose support remains open to challenge. When its claims and structure are already clear, begin at :4.4a.5 with the known premises, inference and conclusion; return to reconstruction if a question exposes an uncertainty. Also use this branch when ordinary wording leaves uncertain what is being asserted, what is offered as a reason, or how the reasons reach the intended conclusion. It applies to arguments in your own draft too. Reconstruction produces an interpretation that can be examined; it does not yet establish that the premises or inference are acceptable. Some recovered arguments are deductive, while testimony, analogy and proposals based on expected consequences commonly remain open to challenge.

##### B.5.RA:4.4a.1 - Recover the question and the claims before drawing links

Read enough of the surrounding text or exchange to identify the question being answered and what the speaker asks the recipient to accept. A recommendation, an assertion about what happened, and an explanation of an accepted event can occur in the same paragraph. Ask of each passage: is this a reason to accept a disputed claim, an account of why an accepted event happened, a question, a request, or background? The word “because” fits both argument and explanation. Their difference here is the work done in the exchange; an explanation can itself contain claims that need argument when challenged.

Write the potentially relevant claims as complete sentences, with enough of their source wording or location to check the interpretation. Resolve “it”, “they”, the occasion and the comparison class where the context permits. Preserve negation, quantities, time, modality and attribution: “Lee says the room may be available” neither asserts certain availability nor independently establishes it. Split a sentence when it contains claims that can be accepted or challenged separately. Do not cut a logical relation into newly asserted facts. “If P, then Q” states a conditional; it asserts neither P nor Q. To use it to reach Q, recover a separate ground for P and preserve whatever qualifications the conditional has.

Clarify only as far as the next use requires. Replacing “works well” with a measured criterion can make a claim testable, but an invented threshold is your proposal until the speaker or source supports that reading. Rhetorical questions can convey commitments, and imperatives can express recommendations. Recover the proposed commitment from context instead of treating every question mark as disposable filler. A literal command alone does not state its justification.

If the conclusion is unstated, propose the claim the offered reasons appear intended to establish. For example, a successful rehearsal with unchanged equipment may support another successful display; it does not by itself establish that another test is unnecessary or that this is the best venue. Keep a reconstructed conclusion distinct from a conclusion you decide to argue for yourself.

##### B.5.RA:4.4a.2 - Compare consequential readings and try a scheme

Where the wording admits readings that change the support, make the alternatives explicit. Compare them with the actual assertions, the question under discussion, surrounding replies and any shared premise that can be established. Prefer the reading that accounts for those contributions with the fewest unsupported additions. Interpret the speaker reasonably, but do not improve a weak argument into a different strong one and attribute the improvement to them. Agreement with the conclusion is no reason to prefer a reading.

Ask a discriminating question when a reply is available: “By free, do you mean unbooked at that time or without a hire charge?” If the source cannot be consulted, preserve both live readings or limit the use to what they share. Choosing a provisional reading can be sufficient for examining its consequences; it does not resolve the remaining ambiguity.

An **argumentation scheme** describes a recurring arrangement of premises and conclusion. Try one as a hypothesis about the inference. Fill its places from the recovered claims and identify every place still missing. For expert opinion, find the relevant expertise, the actual assertion and the proposition it is offered to support. Someone who handles a booking calendar can instead know its entries through ordinary access. A professional title by itself does not establish either expertise about this question or knowledge of this occasion.

A missing scheme premise gives a question, not permission to invent its answer. Look for evidence that the source relies on it; if none is available, retain the gap, try a better-fitting scheme, or describe the inference directly. For instance, calling a new expense “a waste” need not invoke sunk costs. The latter reading needs past investment and a claim that stopping would waste that investment. An argument against an unnecessary future expense can have neither. Scheme selection follows the offered support, not the word that first caught the reader's attention.

##### B.5.RA:4.4a.3 - Recover the intermediate conclusions and missing grounds

Work backward from the proposed conclusion and forward from its offered reasons. Ask at each join what these reasons, if accepted, support immediately. A booking report may establish availability; availability together with a claim about the rehearsal's requirements may establish feasibility; feasibility still needs a choice rationale before it supports selecting the venue. Write an intermediate conclusion when this distinction changes what can be challenged or reused. It has both roles: the result of one inference and a premise of another.

To find a hidden premise, explain why the stated reason bears on its target. Look for the condition, comparison, generalization or value judgement that would license that particular move. Ask whether the supplied reason could hold while the conclusion fails; the resulting counterexample can reveal an omitted qualification. For “the hall is available, so use it”, a hall too small for the cast exposes a requirement that availability alone cannot answer. An unfamiliar subject inference needs its subject method, not a sentence invented merely to make the arrow look complete.

Retain the different grounds for an addition. A context-supported implicit premise belongs to the recovered interpretation, with the supporting context made clear. An unresolved candidate premise remains a question about what the speaker meant. A premise you independently investigate or introduce belongs to your repaired argument. One bracket style is optional; these distinctions are not. Do not add a premise equivalent to “these premises establish this conclusion” as an explanation of why they do.

Try the resulting account against the original passage. Can it explain the role of each relevant contribution and the conclusion's stated strength? Does it attribute something the source could consistently deny? Does an apparently unused sentence support an intermediate claim, supply an objection, or merely explain the occasion? Revise the arrangement when these questions expose a better reading. Leaving a passage as background can be faithful; making every sentence support the final conclusion cannot be a goal.

##### B.5.RA:4.4a.4 - Make the selected structure inspectable

Use a short outline or **argument map** when the dependencies would otherwise be hard to inspect. Write a claim at each point where someone may need to accept, contest or reuse it. Connect an offered reason to its particular target and explain the inference. The link means support; it does not mean temporal succession, physical causation or part–whole membership. A causal claim can itself be a premise or conclusion.

Put jointly used premises in one reason group. To check the grouping, remove one premise in thought and ask whether the *same offered inference* still supplies a reason for that target. If its bridge is gone, keep the co-premises linked. If another complete reason remains, show that reason separately. Separate reasons need not each be sufficient for the contemplated use; several weak reasons may be cumulative, and their adequacy remains a subject judgement. Retain common sources or assumptions across groups so that repeating one report does not create independent evidence.

Use A.6.3.RT.OE when the expression obscures the recovered relations. Show an intermediate conclusion at both of its uses and keep an objection attached to the claim or inference it challenges. Preserve source attribution and consequential uncertainties in the outline. Read it back as ordinary reasoning and compare it with the text. If the map seems more certain, more comprehensive or easier to defend, find what was lost or added. A tidy layout cannot settle a competing interpretation.

The selected structure can now be used for criticism. An answer may require changing the structure itself: a supposed eyewitness report can turn out to be an inference from an observed clue, as in :5.5. Return to the interpretation and grouping when that happens, rather than merely adding a negative mark to the first scheme.

##### B.5.RA:4.4a.5 - Ask a consequential question and revise its target

Turn the scheme's **critical questions** into questions about this case. For expert opinion, ask about relevant competence, the domain of the claim, the statement actually made, reliability, disagreement and the underlying evidence. Select questions whose answers could change this use, and add a question exposed by the circumstances even if it is absent from the standard list. Name what answer or evidence would resolve the concern. The question ‘Did the specialist assess this adapter?’ can lead to confirmation, a request for evidence, or a finding that the cited assessment concerns another setup. Those outcomes require different revisions.

To construct a question rather than repeat a catalogue, isolate a consideration carrying the inference and ask both what supports its application here and what could make that application fail. For Dana's expertise, ask which experience supports this assessment and which part of the setup might fall outside that experience. Seek the relevant facts on both sides; do not invent adverse evidence to fill the second answer. Add a contextual consideration when its absence could change the conclusion, such as whether the tested configuration is still available. Explain how the answers affect support in this case; they are not votes.

Place an objection at its target:

| What the objection challenges | What to examine next |
| --- | --- |
| A premise | The ground for accepting that premise, and every reason group that needs it. |
| The transition from premises to conclusion | Whether the stated circumstances permit that inference, even if its premises are accepted. |
| The conclusion | The opposing argument and its grounds alongside the argument already offered. |

An objection also needs grounds. A question can expose an unsupported premise without establishing its negation. A reply that answers the question may restore that support; a reply that merely repeats the conclusion does not. When disagreement persists, locate whether it concerns evidence, an inference condition or the criterion for accepting the result. Use the relevant practice to settle that issue. Neither the number of questions answered nor the number of arrows is a rule for combining support.

Return the strongest conclusion the surviving grounds justify for the intended use, with an unresolved condition when necessary. Apply B.5.RR to a changed premise or inference condition and follow its affected dependents. Keep a sufficient alternative that survives. If no adequate route remains, obtain the missing ground, narrow the conclusion or leave it unresolved. A map and a familiar scheme organize this work; the subject reasoning still determines what follows.

When this is your own draft, use the exposed gaps to obtain grounds, alter the argument or narrow the conclusion before rewriting the prose. In a joint reading, compare the specific claims and links on which the participants differ; agreement on the drawing is neither agreement with the conclusion nor evidence that it is true. Ask each reader what in the text supports their interpretation, and revise the account or keep the difference explicit. Learning to do this reliably can require practice with feedback; a completed map or a worked example does not establish that capability.

#### B.5.RA:4.5 - Use the recovered reasoning and stop at a useful result

Perform the use named in :4.1. Apply the result under its conditions, explain the decisive step, identify a consequential criticism, or name what must be recovered before the use is possible.

Make the conclusion no stronger than the recovered reasoning supports. If recovering the argument reveals an open premise, state its effect on the intended use. When several sufficient arguments are available, an unresolved branch may be bypassed through a branch whose premises and reasoning are adequate.

If a premise or requested conclusion changes, use B.5.RR to follow the affected reasoning and derive what still follows. The recovered dependencies supply the starting point for that work. An unchanged, adequately supported part can be reused.

C.11.DUA governs whether more checking or information is worth obtaining for this decision. Understanding an argument, verifying its correctness and establishing its real-world premises can require different work. Select further work from the unresolved question. When the work is divided among agents, give the next contributor the premises at the missing transition, the result needed there and the intended use. On return, connect the supplied reasoning to the argument's main reason. Use the explanation or working notation that makes the continuation possible.

### B.5.RA:5 - Archetypal Grounding

#### B.5.RA:5.1 - Understanding why the sum of odd numbers is a square

Consider this compressed argument: “The sum of the first n positive odd numbers is n²: the sum and the square start at zero, and both increase by 2n+1 when n increases by one.” The statement concerns every nonnegative integer n. A reader recognizes the formula but needs to explain the steps compressed in that reason.

Write S(0)=0 and S(n+1)=S(n)+(2n+1). The main reason is that both the sum and the square start at zero and grow by the same amount when n increases by one. The algebraic identity (n+1)²−n²=2n+1 supplies that connection.

Recover the general transition. Assuming S(n)=n² for an arbitrary nonnegative integer n gives:

S(n+1)=S(n)+2n+1=n²+2n+1=(n+1)².

The temporary assumption is the induction hypothesis. It supports the successor step. Together with S(0)=0, that step establishes the statement for every nonnegative integer by induction.

For n=3, the sum is 1+3+5=9. Adding the next odd number, 7, gives 16. This instance makes the equal-increment operation visible. The argument's reach comes from the arbitrary n, the base value and the induction rule.

A square drawing gives another way to follow the increment: grow an n-by-n square with a row of n cells and a column of n+1 cells. That adds 2n+1 cells. The drawing and algebra expose the same increment under the counting interpretation.

The reader can now explain the role of the initial value and successor step. If the next task instead asks for the sum of n odd terms beginning at 3, the changed range opens a revision: use the established sum through the (n+1)th odd number and remove the first term, giving S(n+1)−1=n²+2n. For four terms, 3+5+7+9=24. The reusable contribution is the recovered relation between range, initial value and increment.

If the original question asked only for 1+3+5, direct addition would already supply the result. Recovering the general argument earns its effort when explanation, general use or revision needs it.

#### B.5.RA:5.2 - Understanding a drawing-recovery argument

A team needs to open an archived engineering drawing for reuse. Someone argues that the drawing is recoverable because three backup copies exist.

Recover the method behind that conclusion. For the encrypted-backup route, the needed contributions are readable stored data, an available way to decrypt it and a decoder for the drawing format. Their joint use produces a readable drawing. Having more copies addresses loss of stored data, while all three may still share one decryption key.

Suppose the key is unavailable. The backup count leaves the decoding route incomplete. The next useful question is whether the key can be recovered or another usable copy obtained. The recovered argument identifies that missing prerequisite.

Now suppose a separate plaintext copy in a readable format is available. That gives a different route to the drawing and permits the team to continue without recovering the encryption key for this use. The original encrypted route remains conditional.

The result is a usable recovery choice or a focused request for a missing contribution. A later claim that the opened drawing describes the present equipment requires its own comparison; the file-opening argument answers the immediate recovery question.

#### B.5.RA:5.3 - A projection argument with two grounds and one shared condition

A seminar organizer receives the message: ‘The slides should display correctly. Dana says the projector is compatible, and yesterday's rehearsal worked.’ The organizer needs to decide whether another display test is needed before using projector P with laptop L and adapter D. The relevant technical claim C is: **the current PDF can be displayed at 1080p by this setup**. It says nothing yet about sound, remote attendance or uninterrupted operation for an entire seminar.

**Construct the offered argument.** Ask what ‘compatible’ and ‘worked’ mean here. Suppose Dana maintains these projectors, has relevant technical expertise, and explicitly confirms her claim: ‘The current PDF can be displayed at 1080p using P, L and D at the current settings.’ Separately, the organizer personally inspected all pages of the current PDF during the rehearsal and found them displayed correctly at 1080p. Recover the condition S: the equipment, PDF and settings relevant to this result have not changed.

The expertise and the assertion work together in the first reason. Neither ‘Dana is an expert’ alone nor an unattributed compatibility sentence supplies that reason. The rehearsal is a different ground: it is an observed instance under the required setup. Its use for another showing depends on S and on the ordinary technical judgement that the successful test remains applicable. It is not a deductive guarantee of future operation.

The following outline is an argument map. Braces group premises used together; arrows mean support for C, not physical causation or event order.

```text
R1: {Dana has relevant expertise; Dana asserts C for P/L/D; S}
  --expert-opinion inference--> C
R2: {the organizer observed the current PDF displayed correctly on P/L/D; S}
  --applicable rehearsal result--> C
```

R1 and R2 are separate grounds, but they share S. R2 is not merely another report of Dana's judgement. There is no numeric independence or probability claim.

**Question the ground.** A colleague asks, ‘Did Dana assess this adapter, or just the projector's ordinary input?’ Dana replies that her message was shorthand: she knows P and L but had assumed that D was compatible. This answer removes the claimed coverage of her assessment. Mark the objection at R1's asserted scope and its use for C. The resulting conclusion is not ‘the slides cannot display’. R2 still supplies the observed result for P/L/D. If that rehearsal is an adequate technical basis for this modest use and S holds, the organizer can use C on R2 alone. The map records why losing one reason need not lose the conclusion.

**Revise after a common condition changes.** Before the seminar, D is replaced by D2. B.5.RR now follows the changed configuration through both uses of S. The rehearsal remains evidence about D, and Dana's statement supplies no assessment of D2. C for the new setup is unresolved. Testing the new setup, restoring D, or obtaining an applicable technical account can close that gap. Repeating the old positive reports cannot.

Suppose a test with D2 then shows that the current PDF is not displayed under the intended settings, after the operator checks the connections and follows the equipment's setup instructions. This is a new opposing observation for that tested setup. The organizer can report that the attempted display failed and return to technical diagnosis; the observation alone does not identify which component caused the failure.

**Separate the technical result from the practical proposal.** ‘Therefore use P’ introduces another inference. It needs the seminar's display requirement, an available way to keep the tested setup, and comparison with relevant alternatives and costs. If using P prevents another booked session from running, that consequence can defeat the proposal while C remains supported. PSD.8/.9/.11 supply the option, value and consequence work. The receiving decision uses the qualified technical result instead of silently expanding it into a recommendation.

The useful return is a conclusion with its surviving reason and its next change condition: use the rehearsal for the unchanged setup; reopen compatibility after replacing the adapter; treat the later failed display as a result to diagnose. Another person can challenge a specific connection and see what needs to be redone.

#### B.5.RA:5.4 - From an ambiguous message to a conditional venue argument

An amateur theatre group is choosing a room for a complete three-hour rehearsal on Friday evening. It receives this message:

> Use the school hall on Friday. If it is free, we can rehearse there together. Noor says it is; she manages the bookings. We missed last week because the band had the hall. Paying for the studio would be a waste.

**Begin with possible readings.** “Free” could mean unbooked or without a hire charge. “It is” could refer to either meaning, and “we can rehearse” might concern some rehearsal rather than the complete three-hour session. The opening recommends a venue; it does not itself justify that choice. The conditional in the second sentence supplies a proposed relation between availability and rehearsal feasibility. It does not establish availability.

A first sketch that puts “the hall is free” and “we can rehearse” into two boxes as asserted facts has strengthened the text. A sketch that puts every remaining sentence directly under “use the hall” hides how the recommendation is supposed to follow. Two more faithful readings remain: the message could argue from available space or from avoiding a hire charge. The booking role makes the first reading plausible, but does not prove which meaning the speaker intended.

Ask the organizer what was meant. Suppose the reply is: “I meant unbooked for our Friday rehearsal. Noor told me there was a free slot. I was explaining last week's cancellation, which we all already know about.” This supports the availability reading and identifies the “because” sentence as an explanation of the accepted cancellation. Keep that explanation as context; it supplies no evidence that the hall is available this Friday. The reply still does not establish the slot's duration or the relative cost.

**Extract the claims without filling the gaps.** The organizer's proposed conditional is now: if the school hall is available for the required Friday session, the group can complete that rehearsal there. Noor is reported to have said there is a free slot. Managing the bookings gives a reason to treat her as able to know the booking entries, not as an expert on every condition of a rehearsal. Recovering her statement's actual scope is necessary before using it for the three-hour claim.

The sentence about waste suggests a practical choice: avoid paying for an alternative when an adequate option already exists and the payment buys no relevant advantage. It does not mention past investment or abandoning an earlier undertaking. A sunk-costs scheme therefore adds the wrong premise. The useful question is which present and future differences make the studio expense unnecessary.

A provisional structure makes the missing intermediate result and grounds visible. Braces below group co-premises. “Reported” retains attribution; “proposed implicit” identifies a reading supported by the waste remark but not yet confirmed. Arrows mean the indicated support.

```text
{Noor manages the bookings; Noor is reported to say a slot is free}
  --ordinary knowledgeable-source inference-->
  A: a Friday slot is available (its hours remain unconfirmed)

{A with the hours required by the group;
 the organizer's conditional about completing the rehearsal}
  --conditional application-->
  F: the group can complete the required rehearsal in the hall

{F;
 D: using the hall has lower relevant burden and the studio adds
  no compensating benefit [needed comparison, not supplied];
 V: choose the adequate option without that unnecessary burden
  [proposed implicit choice rationale]}
  --practical inference--> C: use the hall for this rehearsal
```

A is not yet the premise about the required hours, and F is not simply another independent reason alongside Noor's report. F depends on the availability claim and the organizer's conditional. D is an exposed need for evidence, not a fact extracted from “waste”. The practical argument remains conditional on it and on the other requirements in F. The map therefore recovers both the plausible offered reasoning and what it has not supplied.

**Use the structure to ask the next question.** The availability claim affects every later step, so ask Noor for the actual interval before making a booking. She replies: “The hall is unbooked from 18:00 to 20:00; another group has it after that.” The actors need 18:00 to 21:00 for the complete run. Preserve Noor's narrower claim; do not revise it into a false claim that the hall is occupied all evening. Replace A's uncertain scope with the two-hour interval. That interval does not supply the required three-hour premise, so the route to F and C fails for the intended session. It is unnecessary to settle the cost comparison to reach this result.

B.5.RR follows that affected route while retaining the usable booking information and last week's explanation. A shorter rehearsal, a different time or the studio can become alternatives, but each changes a condition or opens another argument. The source has not justified any of them merely by losing its first recommendation. If the group changes the task to a two-hour scene rehearsal, reassess the conditional's remaining requirements and the practical comparison for that new use.

**Separate reconstruction from a repair.** Suppose the reader now checks room capacity, access for every actor and both venues' charges. Those findings may help construct a better choice argument. They are new grounds obtained by the reader. They do not make the original message complete or turn its ambiguous “free” into a statement about price.

#### B.5.RA:5.5 - An expert's title cannot turn a clue into an observation

A workshop colleague writes: “The parcel has arrived. Noah, our electronics expert, says so: the goods trolley is back by the door.” The recipient wants to tell an assembler that the replacement parts are ready to collect.

Trying expert opinion first exposes a mismatch: electronics expertise does not establish knowledge of this delivery. Ordinary access could matter instead. A person who checked the parcel could report its arrival without being an expert. Before replacing the first scheme with knowledgeable testimony, recover what Noah actually knows.

Ask, “Did Noah receive or see this parcel, or infer its arrival from the trolley?” Suppose Noah replies, “I saw the trolley. I haven't looked for the parcel; deliveries usually bring it back.” Now the distinction changes the structure:

```text
{Noah saw the trolley by the door; his report is usable for that observation}
  --ordinary observation report--> T: the trolley is by the door

{T; a proposed connection between this trolley's return and this parcel}
  --inference from a clue--> P: this parcel has arrived
```

Noah's claim about the trolley can remain credible while his conclusion about the parcel is unsupported. The observation and inferred arrival were compressed into one attributed statement. The repair separates them and locates the missing connection. It does not establish that Noah was dishonest, that the parcel is absent, or that a witness's every claim needs specialist credentials.

Ask what other work moves the trolley and whether this delivery was due to use it. Suppose the workshop uses the same trolley for outgoing parcels, and today's dispatch account explains its current position. That removes the offered clue's claimed discrimination for this arrival. The recipient can check the receiving record or inspect the parcel location. Either would be a new ground; repeating Noah's title supplies none.

This differs from a disagreement over the trustworthiness of a witness who actually saw the parcel. In that case the disputed ground would be the report. Here the observation is accepted and the disputed transition is from trolley position to this parcel's arrival. The first scheme has been abandoned for a substantive reason, the map has changed, and the next inquiry follows the remaining gap.

### B.5.RA:6 - Bias-Annotation

A familiar scheme label can make a reader force the text into its expected premises. A fluent paraphrase can quietly turn a condition into a fact or a tentative report into certainty. Return the proposed structure to the source and the question being answered, especially when the map looks stronger than the passage.

Familiar vocabulary and a correct-looking calculation can create confidence before the reasoning has been recovered. Conversely, checking every line can consume attention while leaving the role of a lemma unexplained. Use the local transition and the main reason together.

AI-generated formal proofs make the distinction consequential: a checked formal derivation supplies a result under its formal definitions, while the intended statement and the explanatory structure needed for reuse may still need recovery. The relevant comparison is the one that can change the contemplated use.

### B.5.RA:7 - Conformance Checklist

For the argument and use being recovered:

1. The intended use and the conclusion's domain and conditions are recoverable.
2. The explanation states the main reason for the result and connects it to the decisive steps.
3. The needed transitions identify their premises, inference or operation and result.
4. Joint premises, sufficient alternatives, shared assumptions and temporary assumptions retain their different roles.
5. The reader can perform the intended use or identify the missing transition or premise that prevents it.
6. A small instance supports the explanation at its stated scope; a general conclusion has its corresponding reasoning.
7. Further checking is selected for an unresolved question, and adequately supported parts remain reusable.

For an argument using :4.4a, also inspect whether the claims preserve the source's scope, conditions and attribution; a consequential competing reading has been resolved or retained; and the selected scheme fits the offered reasoning. Intermediate conclusions and joint reasons must expose the actual dependency. Reconstructed premises and conclusions remain distinguishable from supplied ones and from the reader's new grounds. Each consequential objection has a target and grounds. A changed condition should revise the affected support without automatically asserting the opposite conclusion.

These are questions about the recovered reasoning. Their answers may already be evident in the working explanation or application.

### B.5.RA:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Failure in the working situation | Repair |
| --- | --- |
| Choosing a scheme from a keyword or title and supplying its absent premises | Match the actual claims; recover contextual evidence for an implicit premise or revise the scheme. |
| Splitting a conditional into two asserted facts | Keep the conditional relation intact and obtain a separate ground for its antecedent before using it. |
| Making a charitable repair indistinguishable from the source's argument | State which additions have contextual support and which are your new grounds or proposed revision. |
| Paraphrasing successive claims while the inference remains missing | Apply the relevant definition, rule or earlier result to the transition's actual premises. |
| Checking local steps while failing to explain why a lemma or construction appears | Recover the difficulty that contribution resolves and connect it to the conclusion. |
| Treating several uses of one premise as several independent grounds | Keep the common prerequisite visible and examine its role in the needed branches. |
| Promoting a temporary assumption to an established premise | Recover the subargument and the conclusion obtained when that assumption is discharged. |
| Using one example to claim that the general statement has been proved | Recover the argument that covers the stated domain; retain the example as an illustration of it. |
| Demanding a complete reproof when the task only needs an established result under its stated conditions | Use that result at the needed level; open its internals when the new question requires them. |

### B.5.RA:9 - Consequences

A recovered argument can support application, explanation, criticism and later revision. Work can be divided around meaningful intermediate results, and a request for help can name the transition that remains obscure.

The method can reveal that the source's conclusion exceeds its support or that the reader lacks a prerequisite. It cannot supply every missing subject method. Its economical stopping points are a sufficient argument for the use, a useful conditional conclusion or a localized gap.

### B.5.RA:10 - Architectural Rationale

A source orders its text for exposition; the argument relates premises, intermediate contributions and conclusions. Understanding therefore needs more than following the paragraph order. Backward dependency recovery identifies what the desired conclusion uses, while recovery of the main reason explains why those contributions were chosen.

Local and overall understanding constrain each other. In :5.1, the equal-increment idea explains the role of the recurrence, and the induction step establishes the general result. In :5.2, the recovery route explains why the key and format matter, and their availability determines which route can be used. A fluent summary that cannot support these transitions is insufficient for the intended use.

For ordinary prose, interpretation and evaluation constrain each other without becoming the same judgement. Context can justify reading a statement as a recommendation while its grounds remain inadequate. A later answer can expose a mistaken structure rather than a false premise within the original structure. Claim extraction, comparison of readings and scheme testing make that return possible. Going straight to a familiar scheme saves effort only when the offered inference is already clear; strengthening the source to fit it loses the argument being recovered.

This common method concerns recovery of reasoning already offered for a result. B.5 coordinates the broader inquiry; B.5.RC recovers an auxiliary construction; a subject method supplies an unfamiliar inference. To explain the result to someone else, select the reasoning and representation that make their intended use possible. C.2.8 helps characterize what that recipient can extract under stated preparation and access.

Recovery also makes revision possible. The changed premise can be followed through the contributions that use it, while independent arguments remain available. Revision has its own task and result; recovering the original argument supplies the dependency information it needs.

### B.5.RA:11 - SoTA-Echoing

**Local and overall proof comprehension.** Mejía-Ramos and colleagues distinguish understanding terms, logical status and justifications from understanding a proof's main idea, components, transfer and examples. Their [2017 account of developing and validating proof-comprehension tests](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~jpmejia/files/Mejia_TUES_method.pdf), §2.2, develops the earlier 2012 model and makes the dimensions operational for particular undergraduate proofs. This pattern adopts the combination of local transitions and overall method in :4.2–:4.4. The published assessment results concern those proof-reading settings, while the generic recovery procedure here is a synthesis.

**Self-explanation.** Hodds, Alcock and Inglis's work is accompanied by the [Loughborough guide for mathematics lecturers](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/media/media/schoolanddepartments/mathematics-education-centre/downloads/SE-booklet-guide.pdf). It explains why relating claims to prior knowledge and to other claims differs from confidence reports or paraphrase. This contribution informs :4.4. The evidence reported there concerns undergraduate mathematical proof comprehension; it does not establish the effectiveness of this whole method for every practice or AI agent.

**Later assessment work.** The [PRIUM framework](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11858-024-01628-1), Cooley and colleagues (2024), develops proof-comprehension assessment through questions about definitions, statements and their relationships, with revision informed by discrepancies between intended questions and student answers. That is an assessment contribution to consider when demonstrated comprehension is required. The present method supplies the recovery work; it does not require a departmental assessment programme for an ordinary use.

**AI-assisted reasoning.** Klowden and Tao's [Mathematical Methods and Human Thought in the Age of AI](https://arxiv.org/html/2603.26524v1), especially §4.4, distinguishes a verified formal statement from the intended statement and from the explanatory reasoning around a proof. This pattern adopts the intended-use comparison and the recovery of the method behind the result. The essay provides a contemporary conceptual argument, rather than an experiment validating this procedure.

**Recoverable methods beyond answer production.** The [Math and AI declaration](https://mathandai.org/) raises the risk that rapid answer production can outpace understanding and development of methods. It is a position statement. This pattern takes the resulting recovery question: which reasoning can the next practitioner actually use? Human or AI production does not settle that question; the returned argument and its use do.

**Schemes and argument construction.** Walton's [*Argumentation Schemes & Their Application in Argument Mining*, §§1–4](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/criticalthinking1234/chapter/__unknown__-29/) is a historical methodological source, republished from 2011. It separates scheme recognition from matching keywords, distinguishes ordinary access to knowledge from expertise, and rejects a sunk-costs reading where the required prior investment is absent. These distinctions guide :4.4a.2 and the different failures in :5.4–:5.5. The chapter's recognition method does not establish automated extraction accuracy or a complete scheme repertoire here.

**From prose to a revisable map.** Davies, Barnett and van Gelder's [*Using Computer-aided Argument Mapping to Teach Reasoning* (2021), §§2–15](https://windsor.scholarsportal.info/omp/index.php/wsia/catalog/download/106/106/1083?inline=1) develops claim clarification, context-sensitive reconstruction, intermediate conclusions, hidden grounds and linked premises in §§3–15. Section 2, especially p. 119, also describes maps as support for writing and joint discussion; these are applications of mapping. Adapt that construction in :4.4a and :5.4–:5.5 while retaining source attribution and unresolved alternatives. Treat their term-matching and layout rules as search aids, not universal inference laws. Their conclusion leaves inference objections and fuller evidence integration undeveloped; those questions return here to the particular inference and its grounds. The teaching sequence remains a separate contribution to capability development. The present synthesis is a practitioner method account, not evidence that reading it produces unassisted competence.
**Limits of a question catalogue.** Hernández's [*Disentangling Critical Questions from Argument Schemes* (2023), §§2–5](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10503-023-09613-w), contests the idea that scheme questions supply a complete evaluation. Adapt its attention to the concrete question–answer exchange and the counterargument it can produce. The article proposes, but does not solve, a comparison of argument strength. The present synthesis keeps schemes useful for recovery while requiring contextual grounds for an evaluative conclusion; it adopts no score based on counting failed questions.

**Bounded method choice.** Compare line-by-line paraphrase, full proof validation and use-directed recovery on the same short argument. Paraphrase can retain the odd-sum formula while missing the equal-increment reason. Full validation answers correctness, but may spend effort inside already usable lemmas. Recovering the main reason together with the needed transitions gives the explanation or changed-use basis sought here. Select it when that is the unresolved task; retain full validation when correctness of the complete argument is the required conclusion. The drawing-recovery case extends the dependency method to a practical inference without treating mathematical proof as the sole form of reasoning. Reconsider this recovery approach if prepared readers repeatedly cannot recover why the decisive inference works, while another explanation or reading method enables the same use with comparable effort.

[Baumtrog's *Designing Critical Questions for Argumentation Schemes* (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10503-021-09549-z) contributes paired inquiry into support and possible failure. This pattern adopts that practical move without requiring his complete scheme design or claiming empirical learning benefits.
