### C.32.CONWAY:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when one architecture, selected structure, Work arrangement, communication structure, constraint, or candidate-synthesis result influences the candidate architecture of a changed referent, and the practitioner must decide what to change on either side without mistaking influence for action.

Plain cue: **compare an architecture that influences the change with the architecture being changed**.

Primary working reader: an architect or architecture-responsible practitioner who must compare one independently typed influence source with the architecture of the changed referent and prepare candidate changes without turning either architecture into an actor.

Typical entry situations include:

- a desired product architecture cannot be produced and verified by the current manufacturing and certification arrangements;
- chosen service boundaries still force every delivery team to coordinate every release;
- a method family is proposed for changing documents, but the assigned review roles and evidence structure do not fit what the project must produce;
- an AI-agent toolchain is intended for Work on project products, but its control and evidence boundaries do not fit the changed product architecture; or
- the project needs a source-side, transformed-side, joint, or bounded-mismatch inverse-Conway candidate rather than another diagram of the desired target.

A clean-looking target architecture can still be unbuildable or unproducible, untestable, hard to maintain or evolve, or hard to certify. Existing production, communication, approval, control, evidence, and operating arrangements can constrain the candidate and shift coordination into shared releases, approvals, evidence reconciliation, or exception handling. Treat each such arrangement as an independently typed influence source and recover its direct influence relation when that relation is asserted; the source architecture does not act, and mirroring alone does not establish architecture adequacy.


Start with the domain action: a manufacturing system builds a product, a compiler compiles a program, a service team changes a service, a clinical team treats a patient, or an instructional system teaches a learner. Identify the changed referent first. Only then name an acting system, role assignment, and dated Work when those facts are current. Separately name the architecture or other source that influences the candidate and the exact relation by which it does so.

**First-minute use slice.** A product-family team wants independently replaceable field modules. It identifies the changed referent as the product-family module boundary, the source as one `ArchitectureOf@ManufacturingAndCertification` with a batch line and shared evidence responsibility, and the transformed side as `ArchitectureOf@ProductFamily` with its current field-module boundary structure. No direct architecture-influence kind or predicate has yet been recovered, so the team keeps the pairing as a provisional independent-change pressure with `missing-governor`. It prepares source-side, transformed-side, joint, and bounded-mismatch candidates without naming an actor, role, or Work occurrence. Those facts are added separately only if a later claim needs them.

The primary working object is a local candidate-synthesis frame. When one exact architecture-influence or correspondence relation already obtains, C.32.CONWAY also owns one reusable `ArchitectureInfluenceTransformedArchitectureCorrespondenceRow@Context` episteme about that exact occurrence. The frame, row, changing system, Work, changed referent, architecture claims, candidate palette, and any network that later cites the row remain different objects.

What goes wrong if this pattern is missed: an architecture, organization chart, method family, toolchain, communication structure, or network record is called the transformer and silently receives agency, role, Work, or participation in the change. Or the reverse happens: real performer and Work facts disappear behind a vague claim that one architecture shaped another.

What this buys in practice: the practitioner can prepare architecture candidates while preserving four independent questions—what changed, who acted or performed Work, which sources influenced the candidate, and which exact architecture pair the current correspondence row concerns.

Ordinary working move:

1. name the changed referent and exact changing relation when one is being claimed;
2. name exact acting and performance facts only when current;
3. name each influence source with its kind and direct influence relation;
4. select one pair consisting of an influence-source architecture and a transformed architecture;
5. prepare source-side change, transformed-side change, joint change, or bounded mismatch candidates.

Adoption test: a reader can tell which exact case passes, which does not, what the practitioner changes next, and whether the result is only local synthesis material or a reusable exact pair row.

Not this pattern when the current work is only bounded-change identification, role or Work attribution, module-interface repair, mathematical structural similarity, local choice, or an architecture decision. Use the direct governing pattern and return here only when one pair of an influence-source architecture and a transformed architecture changes candidate synthesis.

Common exits by claim kind:

- `A.3.4` or `A.3.4.P` for the bounded change and changed referent.
- `A.12`, `A.15.1`, and direct role-relation and Work-relation owners for acting system, role assignment, dated Work, and work-to-change facts.
- `A.6.M` for module-interface repair.
- `C.32.ACS` for current architecture-characteristic criteria rows and `C.25` for any composite Q-Bundle and exact slot used by the trade-off.
- `C.29` and the project-selected structural-equivalence pattern for structural similarity.
- `A.19.CPM` for explicit comparison and `A.19.SelectorMechanism` for set-returning selection.
- `G.5` for selected-set publication; `C.18` and `C.19` for archive, front, or pool-treatment policy.
- `C.11` for fixed local choice and `C.32.PAD` for a project architecture decision.

The first useful output is `ArchitectureInfluenceTransformedArchitectureCorrespondenceFrame@Project`. It is a working record for candidate synthesis, not an acting entity, exact relation occurrence, architecture decision, or structural-equivalence claim.

For a first pass, fill only the bounded context, synthesis question, independently identified changed referent, source and transformed architecture refs, one selected structure on each side, either the current governed characteristic refs or plain provisional characteristic heads, the applicable candidate-form heads, and the next governing pattern. Assert an influence row only when its direct relation is current; otherwise keep one explicit provisional pressure in `provisionalArchitectureCharacteristicHeads[]` and its exact return. The first-minute case above can be filled as follows:

```text

This sparse frame asserts no influence occurrence and no exact pair row. The four candidate refs are first-pass heads, not comparison-ready configurations. Add acting-system, role-assignment, dated-Work, exact-pair-row, C.29, network, publication, comparison-ready gain/loss/preservation, and any additional source-return fields only when the corresponding claim becomes current; adding them refines this frame without changing its changed referent, architecture pair, or provisional pressure.

The two project-use fields are unchanged. `@Project` remains a compatibility and retrieval cue only. If the frame is used in one actual project, `projectWorkOccurrenceRef` names the exact composite `U.Work` and `architectureCorrespondenceFrameProjectUseRelationRef` names the direct relation by which that Work uses the frame. The frame, synthesis Work, candidates, architecture claims, and project Work remain distinct.

`TransformerTransformedArchitectureCorrespondenceFrame@Project` and the former title “Transformer and Transformed Architecture Correspondence” are lineage and search cues only. They do not name the current Tech object, make any named value an actor, or establish an actor, role, Work, or participation fact.

### C.32.CONWAY:2 - Problem

Architecture influence and action often occur in the same story but are not the same fact. A manufacturing architecture can constrain a product candidate while a manufacturing system performs production Work. A communication structure can influence service boundaries while people or teams perform change Work only through their admitted exact `U.System` identities. A method description can influence a work-product architecture without being a worker. A toolchain architecture can constrain project-task candidates while an admitted execution system acts.

The old transformer/transformed wording hid these differences. It could leave the changed referent implicit, treat an architecture bearer as the performer, omit role assignment and dated Work, or call a source influential without a direct relation. It could also stretch one local architecture pair into a whole recursive transformation-flow network.

C.32.CONWAY repairs the problem by keeping the changed referent, actor and performance facts, influence-source facts, and one exact architecture pair separately recoverable. Conway and inverse-Conway practice then supplies candidate pressure, not a universal relation and not evidence that any source acted.

### C.32.CONWAY:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| Domain action vs architecture influence | A system can act while its architecture or another selected structure influences the candidate; neither fact entails the other. |
| Performance detail vs candidate synthesis | Role assignment and dated Work matter when performance is claimed, but candidate architecture work must not invent them from an influence diagram. |
| Exact influence vs useful local frame | A local compound correspondence can guide candidate synthesis before a reusable episteme about an obtaining exact relation can be asserted. |
| One pair vs recursive network | One architecture pair can qualify a network reading, but the pair is neither the network nor a cross-flow relation by citation. |
| Desired transformed architecture vs source-side constraint | The transformed architecture may need a structure the current influence-side arrangement cannot sustain. |
| Evolution window | A correspondence that works now can fail when either selected architecture, the direct relation, or the changed referent changes. |

### C.32.CONWAY:4 - Solution

Build the local synthesis frame first. Admit a relation kind only through its relation-kind admission owner and direct settlement. Use that owner's predicate and applicability to test the current pair. If current facts or constituting history satisfy the predicate affirmatively, one world-side occurrence obtains and the row may cite its exact identity. If the predicate is false, no exact pair row is asserted. If the current facts do not decide it, keep the correspondence synthesis-local and name the missing grounding or information-sufficiency boundary. Use `missing-governor` only when no direct relation kind and predicate govern the intended pair and use.

#### C.32.CONWAY:4.1 - Keep acting, influence, and correspondence facts separate

1. **Name the domain action and changed referent.** Identify `changedReferentRef` independently. Add `exactChangingRelationRef` only under its direct governor; architecture influence does not identify the change.
2. **Add acting and performance facts only when claimed.** Every actor or performer is one exact `U.System`. A claimed role requires an obtaining `U.RoleAssignment`. Claimed performance requires one exact dated `U.Work`, `performedUnderAssignment(W, RA)`, and `S = RA.HolderSystemSlot`, plus the exact actor-side or work-to-change relation needed by the claim. Use A.15.1 multiple-performer forms when several systems perform.
3. **Name every influence source by kind.** Architecture, selected structure, Work, communication, constraint, and candidate-synthesis results retain their kinds and direct influence relations. Influence alone supplies no system identity, role, Work, performer status, changed-referent identity, or transformation participation.
4. **Select one architecture pair.** Name one exact influence-source `ArchitectureOf@Context` and one exact transformed-holon `ArchitectureOf@Context`. Their described holons may differ from every acting system. Record equality only when independent actor and architecture-bearer facts establish it.
5. **Map only structures and characteristics that change the candidate.** Name the source-side selected structure, transformed-side selected structure, expected gain, known loss, evolution window, receiving pattern, and source-return condition. For each affected characteristic, reference only the few current `C.32.ACS` criteria rows and any declared `C.25` Q-Bundle slots that make this trade-off real.
6. **Prepare four candidate forms.** Change the influence-source side, change the transformed architecture, change both, or keep a bounded mismatch with an explicit cost and reopen trigger.
7. **Use C.29 only for structural-similarity claims.** A correspondence row does not establish homomorphism, equivalence, or architecture adequacy.
8. **Stop at the next governed claim.** Send comparison, selection, publication, choice, decision, evidence, assurance, gate, Work, or organization-governance claims to their direct patterns.

#### C.32.CONWAY:4.2 - Exact reusable architecture-pair row

```text
ArchitectureInfluenceTransformedArchitectureCorrespondenceRow@Context <: U.Episteme:
  entityOfConcernRef: exactArchitectureInfluenceOrCorrespondenceRelationOccurrenceRef
  entityOfConcernKindRef: exactArchitectureInfluenceOrCorrespondenceRelationKindRef
  governingPatternRef: direct owner of that exact relation kind and occurrence

```

The row is a `U.Episteme` about one already obtaining relation. It neither creates that occurrence nor mints a universal Conway relation. The occurrence keeps its identity under its direct relation owner and A.6.REL; this row only describes it for the current correspondence use. `entityOfConcernRef`, its kind, its governor, both architectures, their selected structures, and the changed referent are required. If the practitioner has only a useful local compound correspondence claim, keep it in the frame for candidate synthesis. Assert the row only after the admitted relation kind's direct predicate is applicable and current facts satisfy it affirmatively. If the predicate is false, assert no row; if facts are unresolved, keep the frame and name that boundary; if the kind/predicate is absent, return `missing-governor`. None of these branches permits inferring a relation from two architectures.

#### C.32.CONWAY:4.3 - Qualified network reading

The same exact pair row may appear in `architectureCorrespondenceRowRefs[]` of several `TransformationFlowStructureNetworkRecord@Context` values while its pair, relation occurrence, evolution window, correspondence use, and claim scope remain current. Each citation contributes only one qualified architecture reading. The row's optional singular `networkCrossFlowRelationRowRef`, when present, qualifies only the exact current record edition named by that locator; it does not qualify the row's citations from other records. No citation makes the pair row the network, adds a member, or satisfies the network's exact cross-flow-relation discriminator.

Set `networkCrossFlowRelationRowRef` only when the row's exact relation participants are independently grounded in member-flow positions and its `transformationFlowStructureNetworkRecordRef` names the same exact current record whose `architectureCorrespondenceRowRefs[]` citation this mapping is intended to qualify. Resolve that record first, then require exactly one `crossFlowRelationRow` to match the occurrence and complete ordered endpoint-binding identity. That row must preserve the same kind, governor, participant order, endpoints, and bindings as this correspondence row. Zero or several matches, a different record, or a stale record edition leaves the locator unresolved. Do not reuse one locator to qualify another record's citation. A record citation alone infers none of those facts. Actor, role, Work, changing relation, influence relation, and network cross-flow relation remain separately governed even when one case cites all of them.

#### C.32.CONWAY:4.4 - Candidate moves and repair rows

Plain text begins with the domain action—builds, assembles, repairs, configures, treats, teaches, compiles, or evaluates. It then names the acting system and Work only when those facts are current. In a separate sentence it says which architecture or other source influences which candidate through which exact relation. `Creator`, `creation`, `producer`, `transformer architecture`, and `uses` remain ordinary cues, not universal technical labels.

Choose only pressures that change the candidate or protect against a concrete loss. Every `affectedArchitectureCharacteristicRefs[]` value in an exact pair row or comparison-ready candidate must resolve to a current `C.32.ACS` criteria row; when the pressure is one slot of a composite quality family, also resolve the declared `C.25` Q-Bundle and that exact slot. If those governed objects do not yet exist, put plain heads such as independent change, substitutability, evidence reuse, latency, coupling or cohesion, coordination load, and source-return cost only in the local frame's `provisionalArchitectureCharacteristicHeads[]`; never place them in `affectedArchitectureCharacteristicRefs[]`. These heads are discovery cues, not a universal catalogue and not criteria refs. Return to `C.32.ACS` or `C.25` before making a stronger comparison, selection, or decision claim.

| Correspondence repair row | Use | Minimum repair against overread |
|---|---|---|
| `changedReferentRecovery` | The story names a team, line, tool, method, or organization but not what changes. | Identify the changed referent and direct changing relation before making actor or architecture claims. |
| `performerRecovery` | A source is said to build, design, repair, or operate. | Name the exact system, role assignment when claimed, dated Work when performance is claimed, `performedUnderAssignment`, and direct actor-side or work-to-change relations. |
| `influenceSourceRecovery` | An architecture or structure is said to shape a candidate. | Name its exact kind and direct influence relation; otherwise keep it as a candidate cue. |
| `architecturePairRecovery` | Two architectures are compared or linked. | Apply the direct relation owner. With no kind/predicate, return `missing-governor`; with unresolved facts, keep the pair synthesis-local and name the missing grounding; with a false predicate, assert no occurrence; with a satisfied predicate, name the exact obtaining occurrence and pair. |
| `inverseConwayRetargeting` | The desired transformed architecture is sound, but the current source-side arrangement cannot sustain it. | Change selected influence-source structures and record migration cost, new burden, and stop condition. |
| `transformedArchitectureRetargeting` | The source-side arrangement is fixed or too expensive to change in the current window. | Change the transformed architecture candidate and record the lost desired property or exception. |
| `jointCorrespondenceSynthesis` | Neither side alone can carry the architecture characteristic. | Change both sides and record preserved structure, lost structure, and coordination burden. |
| `boundedCorrespondenceMismatch` | A mismatch is tolerable for now. | State exception cost, bounded-use limit, source-return condition, and reopen trigger. |

**Stop condition.** A first-pass frame may stop when it names the changed referent, separately typed source and transformed architectures, one selected structure on each side, either governed affected-characteristic refs or visibly provisional heads with their exact return, the applicable candidate-form heads, and the next governing pattern. Every acting, performance, or influence fact that is asserted must already have its direct basis. Before a candidate enters comparison or reliance, complete its source-side change, transformed-side change, expected gain, known loss, evolution window, receiving pattern, source-return condition, and stop. An exact pair row additionally requires its direct relation predicate to be satisfied and its obtaining occurrence to be identified. A provisional pressure stays in `correspondenceClaims[]` with the exact reason visible: missing governor, unresolved grounding or information sufficiency, or a false predicate.

**Lowering condition.** Lower an exact row to synthesis-local correspondence material when its relation occurrence, architecture pair, selected structures, changed referent, evolution window, or receiving use is missing or stale. Retire a candidate when its source-side change, transformed-side change, bounded mismatch, or known loss no longer belongs to the declared evolution window. Return to A.3.4 or E.18 when the changed referent or flow relation is not recovered, to A.12 and A.15.1 when the issue is actor or Work attribution, and to C.29 when the current claim is structural similarity or preservation.

### C.32.CONWAY:5 - Worked Correspondence Cases

| Grounded working case | Acting and performance facts | Influence-source and architecture-pair facts | Candidate work | Stop or return |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Product family and manufacturing system | The product referent and bounded change are identified independently. The admitted manufacturing system performs exact dated production Work under its role assignment; production and work-to-change relations state its participation without creating the referent or change. | `ArchitectureOf@ManufacturingAndCertification` and its batch/evidence structures influence `ArchitectureOf@ProductFamily` through one direct project predicate satisfied by current facts and its exact obtaining occurrence. The architecture bearer is not inferred to be the performer. | Prepare manufacturing-cell change, product-module split, joint change, and bounded batch exception. | Stop at candidate preparation. Route product choice or architecture decision to `C.11` or `C.32.PAD`; factory Work authorization to its direct Work/governance owner or an `A.20`/`A.21` gate; and certification evidence or assurance to `A.10` or `B.3`. |
| Organization designing and operating a service platform | Each acting team or organization is used only through its admitted exact `U.System` identity; dated design or operations Work and role assignments are named only for the actions claimed. | Communication, deployment, test, and approval structures influence one service-platform architecture pair through their direct relations. | Prepare team-responsibility change, test-responsibility change, service-boundary change, platform mediation, or bounded coordination cost. | Stop before an organization-redesign decision or authority claim; return it to the direct organization-governance owner. Route selected-set publication to `G.5` and an architecture decision to `C.32.PAD`. |
| Review method influencing authored work products | The method description does not act. When review is performed, name the reviewer system, role assignment, dated Work, and exact work-to-change relation. | The review-method or evidence structure influences the authored-section architecture through its exact method-use, evidence-scope, or project influence relation. | Add an exception role and evidence scope, change the method step, change the work-product structure, or reject the automation candidate. | Stop before method governance or publication-face use; return to the direct method-governance pattern and to `E.17` or `G.5` when publication is current. |
| Instructional system changing learner capability | Each instructor or instructional organization is used as an actor only through an admitted exact `U.System` identity; dated teaching Work and role assignment are named when performance is claimed. | Curriculum, feedback, and evidence structures influence the architecture claim about the changed learner-capability referent; they do not become the learner or the performer by influence. | Prepare curriculum, feedback-role, evidence-scope, or bounded-cohort candidates. | Stop before educational policy, evidence-sufficiency, or ethical-mediation claims; return them to the direct policy owner, `A.10`, or `D.4` respectively. |
| AI-agent toolchain changing project work products | An admitted execution system and exact tool-call or authoring Work carry any action claim. | Toolchain control and evidence-refresh structures influence the transformed work-product architecture through exact relations; the toolchain architecture itself does not act. | Add supervision and refresh, change task decomposition, or keep bounded autonomy with source return. | Stop before safety, gate or release, or assurance claims; return them to the direct safety owner, `A.20`/`A.21`, or `B.3` respectively. |
**Network-qualified reading.** A product-development TFS and a production-system-change TFS participate in one selected E.18.NET-conforming network. A current architecture pair row about manufacturing-architecture influence may be cited by the network record alongside a separately grounded obtaining production or project occurrence. If the pair row also carries `networkCrossFlowRelationRowRef`, that locator names this same exact current record edition and resolves exactly one matching row; it qualifies no citation from another record. The pair row remains one reading of one exact architecture pair. It is neither the network nor proof that the architecture-influence occurrence is the cross-flow occurrence.

**Near miss.** A diagram places a factory architecture beside a product architecture and labels the arrow “shapes”. No direct relation kind and predicate govern that pair and use. The frame may retain the pair as synthesis-local pressure, but the exact row and network cross-flow mapping remain absent with `missing-governor`; the diagram does not create an occurrence.

### C.32.CONWAY:6 - Correspondence Failure Modes

| Failure mode | C.32.CONWAY repair action |
|---|---|
| **Architecture-as-actor** | Replace the acting architecture with the exact `U.System`, role assignment, dated Work, and actor-side or work-to-change relation; keep architecture as a separately related influence source. |
| **Influence-as-performance** | Remove role, Work, performer, or transformation-participation inferences that came only from influence. Establish those facts independently or leave them absent. |
| **Changed referent omitted** | Identify the exact referent and changing relation before deciding which architecture is transformed. |
| **Performer without Work basis** | When performance is claimed, add exact dated Work, `performedUnderAssignment(W, RA)`, holder-system equality, and required direct relations; use A.15.1 multiple-performer forms when needed. |
| **Influence source without governor** | Apply the direct relation owner. With no kind/predicate, keep the correspondence synthesis-local and return `missing-governor`; with unresolved facts, name the grounding boundary; with a false predicate, remove the influence occurrence. |
| **Architecture-bearer equality with an actor inferred** | Keep the influence-source holon and acting system unequal unless independent actor and architecture-bearer facts establish equality. |
| **Transformed-side-only inverse Conway** | If the text says inverse Conway but changes only the transformed architecture, name the exact influence-source selected structure that must change or stop using the inverse-Conway claim. |
| **Source-side change without transformed pressure** | If an organization, method, line, or toolchain is reorganized without one transformed architecture and characteristic under pressure, return to the direct Work or organization-design use. |
| **One-sided optimization** | Prepare source-side change, transformed-side change, joint change, and bounded mismatch candidates before claiming the correspondence has been constructively handled. |
| **Pair treated as network** | Keep the exact pair row as one qualified reading; use E.18.NET for network identity, members, and exact cross-flow relations. |
| **Network citation treated as relation admission** | Ground the exact relation participants in member-flow positions and make the E.18.NET composite locator name that same citing current record and exactly one cross-flow row; otherwise remove `networkCrossFlowRelationRowRef`. A locator for one record does not qualify another record's citation. |
| **Mirroring treated as adequacy** | Keep the statement as candidate pressure or use C.29 when structural similarity or preservation is claimed. |
| **Software-practice overfit** | When the changed referent is a product family, manufacturing system, school, hospital, or another admitted non-software holon, transfer only the selected-structure correspondence and affected characteristics; do not import software-service or team ontology. A method-family or method-description label alone does not make the named object a `U.Holon`; if the case uses a method-related holon, identify that exact holon and admit it independently under its direct kind owner. |
| **Static correspondence** | Reopen when either architecture, selected structure, relation occurrence, changed referent, or evolution window changes. |

### C.32.CONWAY:7 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Failed-check repair |
|---|---|---|
| `CC-C32.CONWAY-1` | `changedReferentRef` is independently identified; any changing relation has its direct governor. | Recover the referent and relation or keep the change description provisional. |
| `CC-C32.CONWAY-2` | Every claimed actor is one exact `U.System`; every claimed role has an obtaining role assignment. | Add the System and assignment or remove actor or role wording. |
| `CC-C32.CONWAY-3` | Claimed performance has exact dated Work, `performedUnderAssignment(W, RA)`, `S = RA.HolderSystemSlot`, and direct actor-side or work-to-change relations; several performers use A.15.1 forms. | Restore the Work basis and relations or remove the performance claim. |
| `CC-C32.CONWAY-4` | Every influence source retains its exact kind and direct obtaining occurrence; influence entails no actor, role, Work, changed-referent, or transformation-participation fact. | Apply the direct predicate: missing kind/predicate returns `missing-governor`, unresolved facts stay provisional, and a false predicate removes the occurrence; delete inferred acting facts. |
| `CC-C32.CONWAY-5` | One exact pair row names one influence-source architecture, one transformed architecture, selected structures, changed referent, exact obtaining occurrence, admitted relation kind, direct predicate/governor, and a satisfied affirmative case. | Complete the satisfied case; otherwise keep only the synthesis-local frame and state `missing-governor`, unresolved grounding, or false predicate exactly. |
| `CC-C32.CONWAY-6` | Equality between an architecture bearer and an actor is recorded only from independent facts. | Separate the refs and remove equality inference. |
| `CC-C32.CONWAY-7` | The two project-use fields retain their exact Work identity and direct use-relation meaning. | Add both facts when project use is claimed or keep `@Project` retrieval-only. |
| `CC-C32.CONWAY-8` | Each comparison-ready candidate states source-side change, transformed-side change, expected gain, known loss, evolution window, receiving pattern, source-return condition, and stop; a first-pass candidate head is visibly outside comparison. | Complete the candidate before comparison or keep only its `candidateRef` as a first-pass head. |
| `CC-C32.CONWAY-8a` | Every `affectedArchitectureCharacteristicRefs[]` value resolves to a current C.32.ACS criteria row and, when composite, the exact C.25 Q-Bundle slot; a local discovery cue appears only in `provisionalArchitectureCharacteristicHeads[]` and supports no comparison, selection, or decision. | Resolve the governed ref, move the cue to the provisional-head field and return to C.32.ACS/C.25, or remove the stronger claim. |
| `CC-C32.CONWAY-9` | Structural-similarity claims use C.29 or the selected structural-equivalence pattern. | Remove similarity entailment or apply the direct pattern. |
| `CC-C32.CONWAY-10` | A network record cites the pair only as a qualified reading; any `networkCrossFlowRelationRowRef` names that same exact current citing record, resolves exactly one row there, and its independently grounded occurrence and endpoint bindings agree with this pair. The singular locator qualifies no other record citation. | Remove the network link or repair the citing record, occurrence, and ordered endpoint-binding locator. |
| `CC-C32.CONWAY-11` | Source-return and evolution-window conditions are present. | Add the changed values and reopen trigger. |

### C.32.CONWAY:8 - Common Repair Cues

| Repair cue | Symptom | First repair |
|---|---|---|
| `ArchitectureActs` | An architecture, method, toolchain, organization chart, or episteme builds, decides, repairs, or performs. | Start with the domain action; name the exact system and Work when current, then state architecture influence separately. |
| `InfluenceSourceUntyped` | A source “shapes” the candidate without kind or relation. | Apply the direct owner: recover kind/predicate or return `missing-governor`; if facts are unresolved, keep a candidate cue; if false, remove the occurrence; if satisfied, name the obtaining occurrence. |
| `ChangedReferentHidden` | The pair is named but the object of change is not. | Identify the changed referent and changing relation independently. |
| `PerformerBasisMissing` | A performer is named without assignment or dated Work. | Apply A.12 and A.15.1 and restore the exact performer basis. |
| `TransformedArchitectureNoSourceFit` | The desired architecture cannot be sustained by the current influence-side structures. | Open source-side retargeting, transformed-architecture retargeting, joint change, and bounded mismatch as alternatives. |
| `InverseConwayNoSourceChange` | The text says inverse Conway but names no selected influence-source structure change. | Name that exact structure, affected characteristic, migration burden, loss, and receiving pattern or drop the inverse-Conway claim. |
| `SourceChangeNoTransformedPressure` | A source-side organization, method, line, or toolchain change has no transformed architecture characteristic under pressure. | Route the change to its direct Work or organization-governance pattern until the architecture pair is current. |
| `CoordinationCostHidden` | Visible coupling falls while Work, evidence, approval, manufacturing, or operational coordination rises elsewhere. | Name the exact influence source and relation carrying that pressure; add candidates that expose the shifted cost. |
| `MirroringNoExceptionTest` | Mirroring is used without preserved or lost structure, an exception, or an evolution window. | Keep it as diagnostic pressure or use C.29 for the declared lens. |
| `PairFlattenedIntoNetwork` | One architecture pair is called the entire transformation-flow network. | Restore E.18.NET identity and keep the pair as one optional qualified reading. |
| `BoundedMismatchHidden` | A known mismatch is kept without cost or trigger. | Record bounded use, exception cost, source return, and reopen trigger. |

### C.32.CONWAY:9 - Consequences

| Positive consequence | Cost or trade-off |
|---|---|
| Architecture influence can guide synthesis without granting agency. | Actor, Work, changing, and influence relations must be grounded separately. |
| Exact pair rows can be reused across current network records. | Each reuse must preserve pair, relation occurrence, qualification window, and claim scope. |
| Inverse-Conway work produces explicit candidate changes and bounded mismatches. | Some familiar “transformer architecture” shorthand must be expanded into several facts. |
| Changed referent and transformed architecture stay recoverable. | A useful local frame may remain below exact-row assertion when the governor is missing or case facts remain unresolved. |
| Network recursion remains with E.18.NET. | One pair row cannot stand in for the whole network or its cross-flow relations. |
| Candidate architectures are checked against source-side production, testing, maintenance, evidence, and evolution arrangements. | Changing the influence-source side can be expensive; an attractive transformed-side candidate may therefore be rejected for the current evolution window. |
| Organization, Work, method, tool, and module claims are routed to their direct owners instead of being hidden in an architecture-pair result. | This separation may require the practitioner to follow several separately governed exits before comparison. Mirroring supplies candidate pressure, not architecture adequacy; use C.29 when the claim is structural similarity or preservation. |

### C.32.CONWAY:10 - Rationale

Architectures do not act. Systems act in roles, and dated Work is performed under assignments when performance is claimed. Architectures, selected structures, Work arrangements, communication structures, constraints, and candidate-synthesis results can nevertheless influence which transformed architecture is feasible. C.32.CONWAY is useful precisely because it relates those facts without merging them.

The exact pair row gives one obtaining architecture-influence or correspondence occurrence a reusable episteme. The larger frame remains useful when a project has enough information to prepare candidates but not enough to assert that exact row. This preserves practical forward motion while keeping the exact relation status visible: missing governor, unresolved grounding, false predicate, or satisfied affirmative case.

The four candidate forms remain: change the influence-source side, change the transformed architecture, change both, or keep a bounded mismatch. The split between actor facts and influence facts changes their grounding, not their constructive purpose.

### C.32.CONWAY:11 - SoTA-Echoing

These rows document transfers from source practice into C.32.CONWAY. Each row states which field, repair row, or boundary the draft sets or revises from the source. The source family supports architecture practice; it does not decide actor identity or make a relation obtain.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Melvin Conway, `How Do Committees Invent?` (`https://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper.html`) | Original source for pressure between communication arrangements and the structure of designed systems. | Treat communication and organization architecture as influence on candidates. | `influenceSourceRows[]` and the exact pair row name the source architecture, transformed architecture, selected structures, relation occurrence, and changed referent. | The organization or its architecture is not inferred to be the acting system; candidate pressure is not a universal Conway relation. |
| MacCormack, Rusnak, and Baldwin 2012 mirroring hypothesis (`https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2012.04.011`) and Colfer and Baldwin 2016 exceptions survey (`https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/16-124_7ae90679-0ce6-4d72-9e9d-828872c7af49.pdf`) | Empirical and theory line for product-architecture and organization-architecture mirroring and exceptions. | Use mirroring as a correspondence hypothesis over selected structures and an evolution window. | Failure and conformance rows require affected characteristics, exceptions, source return, and C.29 for structural-similarity claims. | Mirroring does not establish adequacy, actor equality, relation occurrence, or an entire network. |
| DORA loosely coupled teams, last updated 2025-10-20 (`https://dora.dev/capabilities/loosely-coupled-teams/`) | Practitioner line tying architecture, team independence, testing, deployment, and coordination load. | Treat those arrangements as typed influence sources when they constrain a service architecture candidate. | Candidate forms expose source-side retargeting, transformed-side retargeting, joint change, and bounded mismatch. | Team autonomy or work-transfer counts do not identify actors, Work, or an architecture-influence occurrence without their direct facts. |
| Team Topologies key concepts (`https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts`) | Organization-design family for fast flow, interaction modes, cognitive load, platform teams, and evolving boundaries. | Use team types and interaction modes as candidate influence sources, not acting kinds. | Influence-source rows retain exact source kind and relation; candidate rows retain migration cost, burden, and evolution window. | Team-topology vocabulary does not create role assignment, Work, module relation, authority, or decision claims. |
| Current FPF `A.12`, `A.15.1`, `A.3.4`, `A.3.4.P`, `E.18`, `E.18.NET`, `A.6.M`, `C.29`, `C.30`, `C.32`, `C.32.MLAO`, and `C.32.FAIL` | Governing ontology for acting systems, role assignment, Work, bounded change, flow structures and networks, module repair, lens use, architecture claims, candidate synthesis, residual reduction, and failure repair. | Recover participants and direct relations before using Conway wording. | Performer rows, influence rows, exact pair assertion, network-qualified reading, and receiving-pattern exits are separately checkable. | No root Conway kind, universal correspondence relation, acting architecture, or bypass around decision, Work, evidence, or network selection. |

**Source-currentness boundary.** Recheck a row when the changed referent, acting and performance facts, influence source or relation, architecture pair, selected structures, evolution window, source practice, or receiving pattern changes. If the source no longer supports the selected local pressure, lower it to background lineage; do not preserve a technical claim by name alone.

### C.32.CONWAY:12 - Relations

- **Builds on:** `C.32` for candidate architecture synthesis; `C.30` for `ArchitectureOf@Context`; `A.3.4` and `A.3.4.P` for the changed referent and bounded change; `A.12` and `A.15.1` for acting system, role assignment, dated Work, performed-under-assignment, and multiple-performer forms; direct subject relation owners for acting, Work-to-change, and influence occurrences; `A.6.REL` when this episteme consumes occurrence identity; `E.18` for one TFS; and `E.18.NET` for network identity and exact cross-member relations.
- **Uses:** `C.32.ACS` for current architecture-characteristic criteria rows; `C.25` for composite Q-Bundles and their declared slots; `C.32.MLAO` for a cross-scope residual; `C.32.FAIL` for a correspondence repair failure; `C.29` when structural similarity, preservation, mapping, or equivalence is claimed; and `A.6.P.WMR` and `A.6.RCD` when a required direct relation cannot be recovered.
- **Receiving patterns:** `A.19.CPM` for explicit comparison, `A.19.SelectorMechanism` for set-returning selection, `G.5` for selected-set publication, `C.18` and `C.19` for archive, front, or pool treatment, `C.11` for fixed local choice, `C.32.PAD` for architecture decisions, `A.10` for evidence, `B.3` for assurance, `A.20` or `A.21` for gate or release claims, and direct method, Work, or organization-governance patterns when those claims are current.
- **Network boundary:** an `ArchitectureInfluenceTransformedArchitectureCorrespondenceRow@Context` may be cited as one qualified reading in `architectureCorrespondenceRowRefs[]`; it is not the network and does not satisfy an E.18.NET cross-flow relation without the separately grounded obtaining occurrence and endpoint bindings. Its optional singular row locator qualifies only the exact current citing record it names.
- **P2S docking:** `C.32.P2S` may use C.32.CONWAY when a problem-to-structure flow needs one exact architecture-influence/transformed-architecture pair. It does not infer performer or influence facts from the flow card.
- **Boundary:** C.32.CONWAY governs correspondence framing and one exact reusable architecture-pair episteme inside candidate synthesis. It does not govern actor identity, Work occurrence, organization redesign, authority, evidence sufficiency, assurance, gate passage, release, structural-equivalence theory, final architecture decision, or transformation-flow-network identity.

### C.32.CONWAY:13 - Footer marker

`C.32.CONWAY` governs candidate synthesis where one exact architecture or other typed source influences a transformed-architecture candidate through a governed relation. It keeps the changed referent, acting and performance facts, influence-source facts, one architecture pair, and any larger network separately recoverable.
