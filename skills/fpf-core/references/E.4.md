## E.4 - FPF Ecosystem Family Architecture

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative.

### E.4:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when an FPF user, framework author, or steward needs to create, extend, or use an FPF-grounded pattern ecosystem and must know what belongs to FPF itself, what belongs to the FPF Core, what belongs to a domain or local framework, which records carry relation and edition claims, and which neighboring patterns contain the defining content for publication, access, naming, source, currentness, and quality work.

Primary `EntityOfConcern`: the FPF-grounded pattern ecosystem for one named ecosystem question. The first useful result is a direct route or honest stop: name the question, classify the likely case, and point to the next pattern. Open a complete ecosystem-architecture record only when the answer must settle durable architecture or support later reliance.

This pattern buys a practical distinction: a reader can tell whether a claim changes FPF itself as a first-principles framework edition, changes the FPF Core, creates a domain principle framework, creates a local practice framework, publishes or teaches existing content, exposes a skill-pack, index, or response carrier, or an MCP, retrieval, search, or assistant access route, or records a dependency on another framework edition. Use `E.4.FPF` when the work is the form of FPF itself; use `E.11` and `E.17` for first-entry and publication questions; use `E.4.DPF` when the work is to author a domain or local framework.

### E.4:2 - Problem

FPF has grown from a single core pattern set into an ecosystem of core rules, tools, companions, domain frameworks, local practice frameworks, source packs, decisions, quality records, publication and access-facing presentation carriers, and access routes. If those objects are described only by file names, abbreviations, or reader-facing tables of contents, several different kinds collapse:

- a pattern set is treated as a publication or access carrier;
- a local practice framework is treated as an FPF Core amendment;
- a relation record is treated as a method order;
- a dependency on a framework edition is treated as a specialization relation;
- a source or generated carrier is treated as architecture evidence without source-return and preservation claims.

The result is a framework that may look organized but cannot answer ordinary architecture questions: what structure is selected, what depends on what, what can change independently, what is preserved by a projection, and which stronger claim requires another pattern before it is used.

### E.4:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Core stability | The FPF Core must stay stable enough to supply dependable constraints to downstream frameworks, while domain and local frameworks need faster evolution. |
| Reuse and source-local meaning | Domain and local frameworks should reuse FPF Core distinctions, but they must not silently redefine Core meaning or treat a local label as a universal premise. |
| Publication pressure | Readers need all-in-one carriers, tables of contents, cards, examples, and first-entry material, but those carriers do not by themselves settle architecture. |
| Relation richness | Pattern ecosystems need recommendation, specialization, dependency, publication, preservation, evaluation, and source-use relations, but a single "related patterns" list hides the relation function. |
| Source and generation pressure | Source summaries, relation graphs, and generated candidate sets speed work, but their losses and admissible use must be declared before architecture work relies on them. |
| Problem-solving primacy | Frameworks need vocabulary and ontology, but a DPF is valuable only when those distinctions help a practitioner recognize typical problem situations and choose stronger solution moves. |
| Evolution pressure | Framework editions, dependencies, and names change over time, so compatibility, deprecation, supersession, and refresh conditions must be explicit. |

### E.4:4 - Solution

Describe an FPF-grounded pattern ecosystem as a family of framework editions and publication and access-facing presentation carriers, plus access routes, over selected structures. For each durable ecosystem-architecture claim, or technical claim on which later work will rely, state the exact subject and relation and cite the defining or constraining ClaimGraph in its subject pattern. The smallest route below needs no ClaimGraph citation when ordinary guidance or an honest stop already answers the question. A principle framework edition is not merely a bundle of documents, an ontology catalogue, a literature survey, or a guide to talking about a domain. Its pattern language renders a selected architecture of recurring problem situations, forces, known failure modes, reusable SoTA solution moves, consequences, cases, relation records, evaluation methods, and refresh conditions for a declared reader and use. Known failure modes include beginner mistakes and experienced-practitioner failures caused by stale, local-only, or non-SoTA practice.

Start with the smallest route that answers the current question:

1. Name the concrete ecosystem question and who needs the answer.
2. Classify the likely case: a framework-family boundary, an adjacent maintained result, a publication carrier, access-facing presentation carrier, or access route, a DPF-suite question, or another relation already handled by a direct pattern.
3. Point to that direct pattern and state the next useful move, or stop with the exact missing distinction.
4. Open the complete ecosystem-architecture record only when the answer must persist as ecosystem architecture or later work must rely on the selected structures and relations.

This route is ordinary guidance, not a new record or package. A direct pattern or honest stop is a complete first result when no durable ecosystem-architecture record is needed.

Create an ecosystem-architecture record only when that durable architecture or later reliance is current. Use these fields:
```text

This record answers the declared ecosystem question for its intended use. It is not a new root kind, a source of semantic locality, or a substitute for the subject claims and patterns it cites.

Classify the family members as follows:

`Conceptual Core` is the legacy authority and publication-family partition. `First Principles Framework edition` is the whole scoped FPF framework edition as a transdisciplinary first-principles framework. `FPF Core pattern set` is the framework-edition view of the general FPF Core used for dependency, relation, and edition reasoning. These are related views and scopes, not competing core objects.

| Family member | Architecture contribution | Authoritative content loci |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conceptual Core | Core FPF distinctions, rules, and patterns that other FPF-grounded frameworks depend on. | `E.4`, `E.5.3`, and the exact subject patterns containing the defining ClaimGraphs |
| Tooling Reference | Optional tools, schemas, scripts, machine checks, or helper publications that inspect or support FPF use. | Use `E.17` for a source-backed publication face and return to source, `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence, form, carrier, audience, bounded use, and availability, and relevant tool patterns for their declared tool functions; use `G.5` only for a selector-facing selected-tool-set result declaration. |
| Pedagogical Companion | Tutorials, playbooks, worked examples, and learning material that teach FPF without changing Core meaning. | `E.17`, didactic patterns |
| Foundational principle pattern set | Foundational threshold material or principle patterns that may support FPF-grounded use but need settled names and dependency boundaries. | `F.18`, `E.4.PFR` |
| First Principles Framework edition | The scoped FPF framework edition as a transdisciplinary first-principles framework with Core pattern set, publication and access-facing presentation carriers, access routes, relation records, and whole-FPF adequacy route. | `E.4.FPF`, `E.2.DA`, `E.4.PFR`, `E.11`, `E.17`, `G.11` |
| FPF Core pattern set | The current general FPF pattern core as a framework edition. | `E.4`, `E.5.3`, and the current Core subject-pattern descriptions and defining ClaimGraphs |
| Domain principle framework | A domain-bounded framework grounded in FPF and in domain SoTA. | `E.4.DPF`, `G.2`, `E.4.PFAD`, `E.4.PFR` |
| Local practice framework | A framework for one bounded local practice setting—for example a project, organization, workflow, tool, practitioner position, or audience—grounded in FPF and often in a domain framework. Add a local system-role kind, a separate System-classification judgment, or an exact assignment occurrence only when the framework claim independently uses it; recover ambiguous *role* wording through `E.10.ROLE`. | `E.4.DPF`, `E.4.PFAD`, `E.4.PFR`, `G.11` |

#### E.4:4.1 - Place support units and adjacent products deliberately

In this pattern, *product* is Plain management wording for a deliberately maintained result or service boundary. It is useful because it makes a team decide intended use, identity or current state, access, maintenance, refresh, and retirement together. It is not one FPF technical kind and it creates no `U.Product`. Before making a product-boundary claim, name the direct subject—the thing the claim is about—and the relation that carries its identity, edition, current state, provision, or maintenance. The subject may be, for example, a framework-edition episteme, an evidence-package episteme, an admitted System, an admitted service arrangement, a Method, a programme-description episteme, or another result already admitted by its subject pattern. If the direct kind or relation is not settled, keep the management boundary as a proposal and return that exact question instead of inventing a common object kind.

A framework edition is an exact episteme. Treat its Readme, Preface, table of contents, pattern-body collection, framework-scale structure or coverage account, relation or edition note, and refresh route as named publication units in the same managed boundary when they share the edition's declared readers and use, edition boundary, access, maintainer, and change cadence. Being outside the pattern set or in another file does not by itself create another maintained result.

Make a separate adjacent product only when people need to change, cite, use, or maintain its direct subject independently. Look for an independently useful identity, edition or current state, named users and use, an intensional rule for what belongs, access, a maintenance commitment, a refresh or retirement rule, or cross-framework reuse or reliance. For example, a registry, MethodDescription collection, decision-support publication, inquiry evidence package, practitioner guide, pedagogical companion, catalogue, tool reference, access service, or inquiry programme may justify a separate boundary. The label does not settle the kind: a guide or evidence package may be an editioned episteme; a tool reference may identify an episteme, a tool System, or both; and an access service needs its own service and provider-System claims. The list is open, and file location does not decide the boundary.

When the direct subject is independently maintained, keep it separate and point from the framework to its exact edition or current state. An annex may carry a declared snapshot or projection, but it returns to the authoritative subject and does not fork it. When no independent boundary is useful and ordinary framework use needs the material, keep it as a named support publication unit of the framework edition.

One presentation carrier may expose several managed products without merging their direct subjects. Each constituent keeps its own identity, edition or state, form, access, maintainer, and refresh relation; the outer navigation names exact constituents and stays neutral. A result reused by several DPFs may therefore be managed as an ecosystem companion or service product. Shared use does not make it a parent DPF. Open another DPF only when its own field-boundary assessment finds recurring practitioner problems, constructive Methods, an independently useful first cut, evidence practice, and a maintenance boundary.

When *programme* is used, start with what actually continues. An inquiry programme may be managed as a continuing programme or service product, but neither label says what persists. If a subject pattern admits the programme as a System or another exact arrangement, name it. Otherwise name the current programme-description episteme, capable provider and maintaining Systems with their accepted commitments, and any admitted service state. Bounded inquiry projects remain separate Work occurrences, and their results remain separate epistemes. A maintained inquiry evidence package is its own editioned episteme. The management boundary may coordinate these subjects and relations, but it does not turn them into one indefinitely continuing `U.Work` or one generic Product. If the persisting arrangement is still unclear, return that exact architecture question.

DRRs, build manifests, quality runs, digests, logs, and campaign state remain maintainer or process evidence by default. They become reader products only when a separately selected public use gives a direct subject its own maintained boundary.

Use these tests in order: name the intended managed boundary and ordinary use; identify every direct subject, its kind, and the identity or current-state relation used by the decision; group only publication units that share the framework edition, readers, access, maintainer, and cadence; test a proposed adjacent subject for independent use and maintenance; select the smallest useful boundary; then record exact pointers, snapshot return, and neutral-carrier navigation. If a needed kind or relation remains unresolved, record that question and stop short of the technical product claim.

#### E.4:4.2 - Keep several DPF products usable as one suite

Use this branch when several independently maintained DPF products all contribute to one bounded common use and people need that set to remain recoverable across change. Here *DPF product* is Plain shorthand for a managed series of DPF framework editions. Its direct subjects are the exact edition epistemes and their accepted edition relations; the current edition and its basis must remain recoverable. This introduces no generic Product or extra member object.

**DPF suite** is Plain relation-defined wording for exact suite editions connected by accepted `EpistemeEditionRelation` occurrences and kept usable for one bounded common use; it names no separate line object or root kind. A **DPF suite edition** is one exact `U.Episteme`; it is not a member DPF, a second set object, a family, a catalogue, a carrier, or a universal suite product.

For an edition `S`, apply `C.2.1` as `<claim content = J_s, EntityOfConcern = S, effective ReferenceScheme = R_s>`. Here `J_s` is the exact `G.5 JointUseSet` declaration about `S`: one bounded use, unique unordered references to distinct DPF products, an inclusion rule, and sufficient top-level basis pins. `R_s` resolves the edition, use, products, and basis. The edition therefore says which joint-use set it is; no separate suite entity or universal suite-membership relation is introduced.

The set contains at least two DPF products. Each member satisfies the common inclusion rule, and removing it would narrow the declared coverage for that use. One product is a seed or framework, not a suite; do not declare singleton or empty suite editions. The same DPF product may belong to several suites. Membership in one exact edition says only that the product is included for that edition's common use. It establishes no order, dependency, compatibility, specialization, publication, availability, maintenance responsibility, recommendation, or use in a particular answer.

Treat a later edition as continuing the same suite only when an exact `EpistemeEditionRelation` under `C.2.1` obtains. The later edition actually uses the earlier edition as its revision source and preserves the common use, inclusion rule, product-level member grain, the rule that the edition's claims concern that edition itself, and the reader promise. It may deliberately add or remove members and update basis pins. Changing the common use, inclusion rule, member grain, or promise opens a new `E.9` architecture decision. A fork, translation, retargeting, or independent reconstruction is not an edition successor.

Adding a qualifying product or removing one while at least two remain may produce a successor edition. A new edition of a member DPF does not by itself change suite membership: keep membership only while product identity, the accepted inclusion basis, and its exact basis pins remain valid. If that basis is defeated or unresolved, decide through this section and `E.4.PFAD` whether to issue a successor suite edition, warn readers, remove or restore the member, or retire the line. Guide advice, warnings, availability, or currentness may also change. If removal would leave one or no members, mint no singleton or empty edition. Keep the last qualifying edition exact but non-current for the maintained use, warn readers, and decide whether to restore at least two qualifying members or retire the line.

A suite is presented as current only while an identified capable System has accepted a suite-maintenance commitment and readers have a working route back to each edition presented as current. The commitment covers recoverable editions and basis, notice of relevant member changes, a successor/warning/retirement response, and edition access or source return. If no capable System continues that commitment, stop presenting the suite as current, warn readers, and decide whether another System will take it on or the suite will retire. The suite maintainer thereby maintains neither a member DPF nor the guide. The adjective *maintained*, a byline, locator, member list, publication, shared carrier, or suite membership establishes no commitment, availability, or currentness claim.

Choose one truthful exposure:

- give the suite edition its own publication or access route;
- let a separately maintained DPF suite guide carry a bounded projection that names the authoritative edition, captured content, omissions or coarsening, as-of boundary, and working source return; or
- use one neutral carrier that exposes exact suite, guide, and member publications without merging their identities, editions, forms, access routes, maintenance commitments, or currentness.

A locator identifies an edition but does not make it available. A copied member table without a working source return is orientation only. Apply `E.17`, `E.24.PUB`, `C.2.P`, and `G.11` to the direct publication, source-use, availability, and currentness claims. Use `E.4.PFR` only for exact edition-grained dependency or compatibility claims: membership never supplies their endpoints or case facts. Use `E.11.DSG` for the separate guide product and its reader-facing answer.

The ordinary method is:

1. Declare the ecosystem scope and intended architecture use. Cite the exact source, pattern host, selected architecture structure, publication relation, or bounded model-use structure only when the record actually relies on it.
2. Name the family member being created, used, or changed.
3. List the selected structures that matter for the architecture claim: recurring problem-situation structures, known failure modes, reusable SoTA solution-move structures, pattern set, pattern-use relations, pattern-framework relations, decision records, dependency and edition records, publication and access-facing presentation carriers, access routes, source packs, quality records, and currentness records. For PF work, the pattern-language publication carrier exposes a reader-facing expression of that problem-and-solution architecture, not a neutral list of topics.
4. If the family member is FPF itself as a framework edition, open `E.4.FPF` for form, presentation carriers, access routes, and whole-FPF adequacy routing.
5. Apply `E.5.3`: dependencies point toward more stable framework editions. FPF Core does not depend on domain or local frameworks.
6. State publication and first-entry claims using `E.11` and `E.17`; state framework-carrier structure-account assertions using `E.4.FPF` for FPF itself or `E.4.DPF`/`E.4.DPF.DA` for domain and local frameworks.
7. State pattern-use recommendation claims using `E.11.PUR`.
8. When a framework-architecture question is open, record the selected answer in one `E.9` DRR and use `E.4.PFAD` to profile its framework-specific content. Use `C.32.PAD` only for an exact project architecture decision and `C.32.ADR` only to project such a decision into an ADR-like publication.
9. State relation, dependency, compatibility, deprecation, and edition claims using `E.4.PFR` only when its named maintenance use requires that representation; otherwise use the direct subject assertion.
10. Settle names using `F.18`.
11. State SoTA and source-use claims using `G.2`.
12. State currentness, refresh, and edition-change claims using `G.11`, the exact edition values, and their source/currentness assertions.
13. Before using an all-in-one carrier, table of contents, relation graph, summary, skill pack, MCP-backed service, or generated carrier as evidence, state the exact source-return or preservation assertion under the predicate defined in `C.33`, `C.34`, or `C.35`.
14. Evaluate whole-FPF adequacy through `E.2.DA`, DPF or local-framework package adequacy through `E.4.DPF.DA`, individual pattern quality through `E.21`, improve through `E.23`, and use `E.19` only when the local process asks for admission review.

Use this routing table when a proposed change is ambiguous:

| Proposed work | Route to | Blocked overread |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The form of FPF itself changes: README, Preface, ToC, monolith, host set, skill pack, MCP-backed access, or whole-FPF publication/access route. | `E.4.FPF`, with `E.2.DA` for whole-FPF adequacy and `E.4.PFR` for relation or edition records. | Do not treat FPF as a DPF, do not use `E.4.DPF.DA` for whole-FPF adequacy, and do not treat a carrier as the framework edition. |
| Accepted changes are being assembled into an FPF, DPF, or LPF publication, or continuity with a predecessor publication is claimed. | `E.4.PFIP` for the accepted-source and predecessor-preservation comparisons. | Require both PFIP conclusions when both claims are made. Source parity, build success, carrier continuity, and package adequacy answer narrower questions. |
| A distinction or rule is intended to constrain ordinary FPF use across many domains and downstream frameworks depend on it. | An accepted FPF Core amendment decision under `E.9`, followed by the exact subject patterns whose assertions change. | Do not promote a local checklist or domain technique to Core merely because it is useful. |
| A reusable principle supports FPF-grounded work but is not a general Core rule for all domains. | Foundational principle pattern set or other named framework edition, with `E.4.PFR` dependency records. | Do not hide a new framework edition inside the Core table of contents. |
| A source tradition or professional domain needs FPF-shaped patterns. | Domain principle framework through `E.4.DPF`, `G.2`, `E.4.PFAD`, and `E.4.PFR`. | Do not treat a literature summary as the framework. |
| One bounded local practice setting—for example a project, organization, workflow, tool, practitioner position, or audience—needs guidance. | Local practice framework through `E.4.DPF`; keep local source, publication, quality, and refresh records, and state separately any direct relation used for maintenance, responsibility, authority, assignment, or contact. If a load-bearing owner label has no current direct relation, return `missing-governor` instead of inventing one. | Do not make local policy a general FPF rule. |
| Material needed for ordinary framework use shares the framework edition, readers, access, maintainer, and change cadence. | Keep it as a named support publication unit of that exact framework edition and expose it through the edition's carrier route. | Do not create another managed product merely because the unit is outside the pattern set or stored separately. |
| A registry, guide, evidence package, service, programme, or other result has an independently useful identity or state, users and use, content boundary, access, or maintenance and refresh boundary. | Name its direct subject and the relevant relation, keep a separate managed boundary, and point to the exact edition or state; any embedded snapshot returns to that authority. | Shared use, co-location, or one outer carrier does not merge direct subjects. If the kind is unresolved, keep the boundary proposed and return the question. |
| One carrier exposes several managed products. | Keep the outer carrier neutral and retain each direct subject's own form, identity, access, and maintenance relation. Use `E.11.PFP` only for FPF, DPF, or LPF constituents. | Do not give a non-framework subject a framework family, dependency field, or pattern index. |
| Several managed DPF edition series are proposed for one maintained cross-DPF use. | Use `E.4:4.2` to test the common use, inclusion rule, two-member minimum, edition continuity, maintenance commitment, edition-recovery route, and exposure choice; use `E.4.PFAD` when the architecture answer must be selected. | A co-list, shared carrier, guide entry, or the word *suite* establishes no suite edition, membership, stronger relation, maintenance, access, or currentness. |
| Existing material is hard to find, teach, or publish. | Use `E.11` for discovery, the relevant didactic pattern for teaching, `E.17` for a source-backed publication face and return to source, and `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence, form, carrier, audience, bounded use, and availability. Use `G.5` only when the missing value is a selected-set result declaration. | Do not call publication repair architecture repair. |
| A cross-reference claims use, specialization, dependency, publication, source reuse, preservation, quality, deprecation, or supersession. | `E.4.PFR` for the relation function and edition effect. | Do not let a link label decide the relation meaning. |
| A framework split, dependency boundary, presentation-carrier or access-route choice, or adoption consequence must be decided. | Record one selected answer in an `E.9` DRR, using `E.4.PFAD` for its framework-specific content. Use `C.32.PAD` only when the decision is an exact project architecture decision and `C.32.ADR` only for its ADR-like projection. | Do not replace the answer with a diagram, folder, manifest, PFAD relation, or project-specific decision pattern used as the default framework route. |
| A source, search result, transformed view, or generated carrier supplies candidate material. | `G.2`, `C.33`, `C.34`, or `C.35` before architecture use. | Do not treat a carrier as authoritative because it has plausible names. |
| Whole-FPF adequacy, DPF package adequacy, individual pattern quality, repeated improvement, admission gating, or currentness is the live problem. | `E.2.DA`, `E.4.DPF.DA`, `E.21`, `E.23`, `E.19`, and `G.11` according to the claim. | Do not average pattern scores into package adequacy or whole-FPF adequacy, and do not run all quality gates when only one evaluation or refresh question is live. |

This pattern should leave the reader with one architecture sentence: "This framework edition belongs to this family member, expresses this selected architecture of recurring problems and solution moves in pattern-language form, depends on these stable editions, publishes or gives access through these carriers, preserves these selected structures, and states each neighboring claim under its exact predicate or constraint with the subject pattern available as a locator."

### E.4:5 - Archetypal Grounding

Tell: A team creating a hydroponic-cucumber domain principle framework should not place every useful crop-growing rule into `FPF-Spec.md`. It creates a domain framework edition grounded in FPF Core and horticulture SoTA, declares its dependency on an FPF Core edition, records its source packs, drafts domain patterns under `E.8`, and publishes an all-in-one publication carrier for growers or agronomists.

Mini-example:

| Record field | Filled slice |
| --- | --- |
| `ecosystemScopeRef` | `HydroponicCucumberPrincipleFramework@GreenhouseCropDomain` |
| `intendedArchitectureUse` | choose the framework-family, dependency, and publication architecture for the hydroponic-cucumber framework edition |
| `sourceRefs?` | source entries cited by `GreenhouseControlSourcePack@2026Q2` and `CropProductionSourcePack@2026Q2` |
| `patternHostRefs?` | `DPF.GROW.NutrientSolutionMonitoring` and `DPF.GROW.ClimateControlInterpretation` |
| `selectedArchitectureStructureRefs?` | recurring crop-growing problem situations, solution moves, dependency direction, and source-return structure used by this record |
| `publicationRelationRefs?` | the publication relations from `HydroponicCucumberPF@2026Q3` to `GrowerCarrier@2026Q3` and `GrowerReadme@2026Q3` |
| `frameworkFamilyMembers` | domain principle framework; local grower practice framework as a later dependent edition |
| `selectedPatternSetRefs` | crop-growth problem framing, nutrient-solution monitoring, climate-control interpretation, harvest-quality feedback patterns |
| `selectedRelationRecordRefs` | source or decision reuse from horticulture source pack; specialization from general FPF authoring patterns; publication relation to all-in-one carrier |
| `selectedDependencyAndEditionRefs` | depends on `FPFCorePatternSet@Edition`; no reverse dependency from FPF Core |
| `selectedPublicationOrAccessCarrierRefs` | domain all-in-one publication carrier plus readme as first-entry carrier |
| `selectedSourcePackRefs` | greenhouse-control and crop-production `G.2` source packs |
| `qualityAndImprovementRefs` | `E.21` pattern-quality evaluation and `E.23` improvement loop for drafted domain patterns |
| `currentnessAndRefreshRefs` | `G.11` refresh condition when source pack, Core edition, or crop-production practice changes |
| `blockedOverreadRefs` | do not read the publication carrier as the architecture itself; do not read domain patterns as FPF Core changes |

Show: A Codex-process local practice framework may depend on FPF Core and selected architecture-domain patterns. Its handoff patterns, prelanding patterns, and process runbooks can be local framework material. They do not define the FPF Core merely because they use FPF vocabulary and are useful to this workspace.

Show: A generated relation graph over pattern names can help inspect missing relation records. It becomes architecture input only after `C.35` admits the carrier and `E.4.PFR` records the relation functions. The graph's shape alone is not the ecosystem architecture.

Show: In the cucumber DPF, the Readme, table of contents, pattern collection, and coverage account share one framework edition, reader use, access route, maintainer, and cadence, so they remain publication units in one managed boundary. A greenhouse-calibration source registry is revised separately and reused by another crop DPF, so its current registry edition is a separate episteme. One web carrier may expose both, but its links neither merge their identities nor create a generic Product relation.

### E.4:6 - Bias-Annotation

**Scope: limited.** This pattern helps make architecture claims about FPF-grounded framework ecosystems and their maintained publication, access, companion, and service boundaries. It does not supply a universal product taxonomy, a service-design Method, a programme ontology, or a complete content-management system.

The recurrent drift is publication-first architecture: the visible file, all-in-one carrier, card deck, table of contents, or graph is treated as the architecture because it is what a reader sees first. The repair is to name the selected structures and dependency direction first, then use publication patterns to expose them.

Another recurrent drift is Core absorption: useful domain or local material is pulled into the Core because it is well written or broadly reusable. The repair is to ask which domain or local situation the claim addresses and which framework edition should depend on which more stable edition.

| Lens | Declared bias and counter-check |
| --- | --- |
| **Gov** | Favors an explicit intended use, capable maintainer, accepted maintenance commitment, currentness rule, and retirement response. Counter-risk: a useful grouping becomes a mandatory governance form. Keep only claims that change identity, access, maintenance, refresh, or retirement, and use the relevant decision pattern for authority. |
| **Arch** | Favors separating framework editions, support publication units, adjacent results, services, programmes, DPF lines, and carriers before composing them. Counter-risk: decomposition multiplies managed boundaries. Choose the smallest boundary that preserves independent use and maintenance, and let a neutral carrier expose several exact constituents without merging them. |
| **Onto-Epist** | Favors a direct subject kind and identity or current-state relation before technical use of *product*. Counter-risk: an ontology catalogue replaces ordinary architecture work. Keep *product* as Plain management wording, name only distinctions used by the decision, and return an unresolved-kind question rather than minting `U.Product`. |
| **Prag** | Favors observable independence in use, access, maintenance, refresh, and reliance over labels or file layout. Counter-risk: a small guide or service inherits a quality-management, service-management, bibliographic, or content-management regime. Apply the cheapest direct boundary test that can change the decision. |
| **Did** | Favors familiar product wording at first recognition, followed immediately by the exact subject when a technical claim is made. Counter-risk: readers copy the examples as a closed taxonomy. Treat every list as illustrative and make the direct case recoverable in ordinary project language. |

### E.4:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Passing condition |
| --- | --- |
| CC-E4.1 First route and family case | The work names the ecosystem question, classifies the likely case, gives the direct next pattern or honest stop, and opens a complete ecosystem-architecture record only when durable architecture or later reliance needs it. When a record is needed, it names whether the family member is Core, Tooling Reference, Pedagogical Companion, a foundational principle pattern set, a First Principles Framework edition, FPF Core, a domain principle framework, or a local practice framework. |
| CC-E4.2 Selected structures named | The ecosystem-architecture record names its intended use and the problem-situation, known-failure, SoTA solution-move, pattern-set, relation, decision, publication, access, source, quality, dependency, and currentness structures that matter for the claim. Cite a source, pattern host, publication relation, or bounded model-use structure only when the record uses that independently established value. |
| CC-E4.3 E.5.3 respected | Dependency direction points toward more stable framework editions, and Core does not depend on domain or local frameworks. |
| CC-E4.4 Publication and access separated | All-in-one and access-facing carriers, publication units and forms, tables of contents, cards, Readmes, skill packs, MCP or retrieval routes, assistant integrations, actual access, and views remain non-interchangeable; apply the direct pattern to each claim about them. |
| CC-E4.5 Exact predicate and assertion named | Pattern-use, relation, dependency, decision, naming, source, currentness, quality, and preservation claims each name their exact predicate and subject assertion; a pattern identifier is only the locator for the next question's defining or constraining ClaimGraph. |
| CC-E4.6 Source-return present | Any carrier used as architecture evidence states captured structure, lost structure, admissible use, and the source to return to. |
| CC-E4.7 Framework carrier structure-account explicit | A Readme, Preface, ToC, all-in-one carrier, skill-pack carrier, or other form-bearing framework carrier states which framework structures its selected form exposes for whom. An MCP, retrieval, search, or assistant route identifies the first form-bearing carrier or response it reaches and returns to the same account; it is not scored as that carrier. Missing form or adequacy content is repaired as an exact assertion using `E.4.FPF`, `E.4.DPF`, or `E.4.DPF.DA` before adoption or adequacy claims are made. |
| CC-E4.8 Product boundary proportional and typed | *Product* remains Plain management wording. Every boundary names its direct subjects and the identity, edition, current-state, provision, or maintenance relations used by the decision. Framework support units share one boundary only when their edition, use, access, maintainer, and cadence agree; an adjacent subject has an independent use and maintenance reason. Shared use and one carrier are only probes. An unresolved kind is returned as a question, not `U.Product`. |
| CC-E4.9 DPF suite truth | Each current DPF suite edition is an exact self-concerning `C.2.1` episteme whose `G.5 JointUseSet` has at least two distinct DPF products, one bounded use, an inclusion rule, and basis pins. Exact edition continuity, an accepted suite-maintenance commitment, and a working edition-recovery route are recoverable. Membership creates no stronger relation, and singleton, empty, lost-maintainer, projection, and combined-carrier cases follow section 4.2. |

### E.4:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | What fails | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core absorption | A domain or local framework is placed into the FPF Core because it is useful. | Create a separate framework edition with dependency records under `E.4.PFR`. |
| File tree or package manifest as architecture | A folder layout, package descriptor, or manifest is read as the ecosystem architecture. | Use the file or manifest only as a carrier; recover the ecosystem-architecture record, relation records, dependency records, source packs, quality records, exact presentation carriers, access routes, and refresh routes. |
| Publication-only architecture | A table of contents or all-in-one carrier is used as the architecture description. | Add an ecosystem-architecture record and source-return note, then constitute the exact practical-entry and publication assertions under the predicates defined in `E.11` and `E.17`. |
| Ontology or talk guide as framework | A framework names domain entities, terms, or conversation moves but does not identify recurring domain problems, known failure modes, SoTA solution moves, and worked repairs. | Keep the ontology, glossary, or communication guide as support material; create or repair the framework around problem situations, solution moves, cases, and quality routes. |
| Relation flattening | Every cross-reference is treated as the same relation. | Use `E.4.PFR` to state relation function and subject pattern. |
| Outside the pattern set means another product | A Preface, coverage account, or refresh note is given a separate product identity although it shares the framework edition's users, access, maintainer, and cadence. | Keep it as a named support publication unit unless an independent use and maintenance boundary is useful. |
| Product label used as an object kind | A guide, service, programme, registry, System, or episteme is asserted to be the same kind because each is managed as a product. | Keep *product* as Plain management wording. Name each direct subject and the relation used for identity, current state, provision, or maintenance; return an unresolved-kind question when needed. |
| Shared carrier or shared use means one product | A cross-framework registry or service is absorbed into one DPF, or a combined carrier merges a framework and catalogue. | Decide each managed boundary from direct subjects, use, and maintenance; keep exact constituent pointers and let the outer carrier remain neutral. |
| Service or publication scheme used as universal architecture | A full service-management system, bibliographic entity model, or content-management process is imposed on every framework unit, programme, guide, or tool. | Reuse only the distinction that answers the current boundary question; keep service, publication, content, and programme claims under their own subject patterns. |
| DPF list presented as a suite | A title or co-list replaces the bounded common use, inclusion rule, two-product minimum, exact edition, maintenance commitment, and edition-recovery route. | Keep an ordinary list or candidate until `E.4:4.2` passes; then identify the exact suite edition and its direct boundaries. |
| Suite membership inflated | Co-membership is read as order, dependency, compatibility, maintenance, publication, or use in a lookup answer. | Keep membership at DPF-product grain and apply the direct predicate to every stronger claim. |
| Source-carrier authority | A summary, graph, or generated candidate set is treated as authoritative. | Admit the carrier through `C.35` or record preservation through `C.33` and `C.34` before use. |

### E.4:9 - Consequences

This pattern makes FPF ecosystem work slower at the beginning because a framework author must name family membership, dependency direction, selected structures, and the patterns needed for neighbouring claims. The gain is that later work can evolve without hidden Core changes, hidden publication substitutions, or hidden source loss.

It also makes some attractive names and short labels provisional until `F.18` settles them. That cost is intentional: short names are useful only after the value being named, its source-local meaning, and its intended use are explicit.

### E.4:10 - Rationale

The ecosystem needs architecture because FPF patterns, frameworks, source packs, exact presentation carriers, access routes, quality records, and decisions are not one kind of object. A file tree cannot preserve the differences among those objects. A relation graph cannot preserve decision rationale or dependency compatibility. An all-in-one publication carrier, callable access route, or returned access-facing carrier cannot preserve all source-return and currentness obligations by itself. Architecture work must therefore name the selected structures and apply the relevant pattern to claims outside this pattern's scope.

The old Core, Tooling Reference, and Pedagogical Companion distinction remains valuable, but it is only one family partition. Domain and local principle frameworks need their own framework editions so they can depend on Core without redefining it.

### E.4:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Claim | Exact source ref and status | Pattern locus changed | Adoption status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product and service are management-relevant output distinctions, but their labels do not settle every direct subject in a framework ecosystem. | `ISO 9000:2026, Quality management - Fundamentals and vocabulary`, current fifth edition, `https://www.iso.org/standard/9000`. It distinguishes an organizational product output from a service whose delivery necessarily includes provider-customer activity. | Section 4.1 declares *product* to be Plain management wording and requires the direct subject and relation before a technical claim; `CC-E4.8` repeats that test. | **Adapt** the inexpensive product-versus-service question when it changes provision or maintenance. **Reject** the QMS vocabulary as a universal FPF ontology and do not require a quality-management system merely to place one support unit. |
| A maintained service, its provider, and the system used to manage its life cycle are different concerns. | `ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018, Information technology - Service management - Part 1: Service management system requirements`, confirmed current in 2023 with Amendment 1:2024, `https://www.iso.org/standard/70636.html`. It separates the organization and service-management system from the services planned, delivered, and improved. | The programme paragraph names provider and maintaining Systems, accepted commitments, any admitted service state, bounded Work, and result epistemes separately. | **Adapt** provider, service-life-cycle, and continual-maintenance distinctions for an actual access or inquiry service. **Reject** an IT-service scope and full service-management system for a bounded publication or guide; that effort is justified only by the selected service claim. |
| Publication identity, expression, issued manifestation, physical or digital item, and aggregation should not be collapsed into one carrier. | `IFLA Library Reference Model`, July 2024 maintained edition, `https://repository.ifla.org/handle/20.500.14598/40.2`. Its Work-Expression-Manifestation-Item relations and aggregate treatment make publication-level identity and embodiment explicit. | Sections 4.1 and 4.2 keep edition, publication unit, snapshot, projection, carrier, and neutral combined exposure separate. | **Adapt** the identity-versus-embodiment and aggregate-versus-component discipline for framework publications. **Reject** bibliographic entities as the ontology of services, programmes, Systems, or Methods; applying the full cataloguing model would add effort without answering those boundaries. |
| Reusable user and service information benefits from an explicit content boundary, life-cycle management, and tool-independent assembly. | `ISO/IEC/IEEE 26531:2023, Systems and software engineering - Content management for product life cycle, user and service management information for users`, current second edition, `https://www.iso.org/standard/81703.html`. | Section 4.1 groups support publication units by shared use, edition, access, maintainer, and cadence, while independent content gets its own exact edition or state and snapshot return. | **Adapt** the content-selection, reuse, maintenance, and multi-output discipline when the information scale warrants it. **Reject** a component-content system or complete software-documentation process as the default; a separately stored unit is not automatically a separate product. |
| Architecture descriptions separate architecture expression from the architecture and require concern, view, viewpoint, correspondence, and rationale discipline. | `ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022, Software, systems and enterprise - Architecture description`, official current standard ref, `https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html`. | `Solution` distinguishes the ecosystem-architecture record from publication carriers; `Common Anti-Patterns` repairs publication-only architecture; `Relations` cites the exact neighboring assertions and subject-pattern locators in `C.30`, `C.33`, `C.34`, `E.11`, and `E.17`. | Adopt the separation and correspondence discipline; adapt it to selected structures of a holonic FPF pattern ecosystem. |
| Reuse across related family members needs reusable core assets, variation, adoption, tooling, and evolution discipline. | Nazar, `Software Product Line Engineering: Adoption, Tooling and AI Era Challenges`, arXiv:2605.21353, 2026 current survey and reopen trigger for stronger post-2026 SPLE synthesis, `https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.21353`. | Family table separates FPF Core, domain frameworks, and local frameworks; `E.5.3` dependency direction is made a conformance check. | Adapt reusable-core and variation discipline; reject feature-model or software-product ontology as universal FPF architecture. |
| Pattern ecosystems need validation, worked cases, and relation clarity rather than recipe-book pattern lists. | Riehle, Harutyunyan, Barcomb, `Pattern Discovery and Validation Using Scientific Research Methods`, arXiv:2107.06065, 2021 current validation-practice source; Iba, `Pattern Languages as Media for the Creative Society`, arXiv:1308.1178, lineage for pattern-language social use. | `Archetypal Grounding` now includes a filled ecosystem-architecture record; `Conformance Checklist` and anti-pattern rows require source-return, exact relation definitions, and explicit repair conditions. | Adopt validation and example pressure; adapt it through `E.21`, `E.23`, worked slices, and near-miss repairs. |
| Relation-rich architecture should be stated as constraints rather than read as performed-work order. | `Dyad 3.3`, current release dated 2026-08-06, `https://help.juliahub.com/dyad/stable/manual/changelog.html`, with current syntax and analysis documentation at `https://help.juliahub.com/dyad/stable/manual/syntax.html` and `https://help.juliahub.com/dyad/stable/manual/analyses.html`. Dyad components carry variables, parameters, connectors, subcomponents, and relations, while analyses are separate workflows that produce solutions or artifacts. `Modelica Language Specification 3.7`, 2026, `https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/MLS.html`, is retained only as historical declarative/acausal lineage and is intentionally not used as the current SoTA comparator. | Boundary wording in `Solution`, `Rationale`, and `E.4.PFR` keeps relation assertions declarative and separates them from dated Work and its results. | **Adapt** Dyad's separation between relation-rich component description and analysis that produces results. **Reject** its physical-model, equation, solver, simulation, component-language, and analysis ontology for FPF; reject Modelica as the current SoTA basis. |

### E.4:12 - Relations

- **Builds on:** `E.2/P-5 FPF Layering` and `E.5.3` for modular extension, directed dependency, and family-order discipline.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.4.FPF` when the work concerns FPF itself as a first-principles framework edition, its presentation carriers, access routes, and whole-FPF adequacy route.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.2.DA` when the scoped FPF object needs whole-FPF Pillar adequacy evaluation.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.4.PFAD` when the ecosystem-architecture record opens a framework-architecture question; `E.4.PFAD` profiles the framework-specific content, `E.9` supplies the decision-record method and content requirements, and the resulting DRR records the selected answer.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.4.DPF` when the work is to author a domain principle framework or local practice framework.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.4.PFR` when a relation, edition, dependency, compatibility, deprecation, or preservation claim must be recorded.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.4.DPF.DA` when a domain or local framework package must be evaluated as a package rather than as an average of its pattern bodies.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.11` for discoverability, `E.11.PFP` for the common publication form of FPF, DPF, or LPF constituents, `E.11.DSG` for the separately maintained DPF suite guide and its reader-facing lookup answers, `E.11.PUR` for pattern-use recommendation, `E.17` for a source-backed publication face and return to source, and `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence, form, carrier, audience, bounded use, and availability.
- **Coordinates with:** `G.2`, `G.11`, `C.33`, `C.34`, and `C.35` for source, currentness, preservation, and produced-carrier admission claims.
